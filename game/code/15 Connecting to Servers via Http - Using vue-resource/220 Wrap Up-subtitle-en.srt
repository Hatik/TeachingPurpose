1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:06,620
In this module we learned a lot about using HTP in our beauteous application.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,750
We started with simple HTP requests using the resource which was set up you're added With The You Use

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,280
and then you resource.

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:21,370
And we started simple way of using this follows NAHB posed get and so on passing to you or the first

5
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,620
argument data is the second argument and so on.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,820
We then Elzevir had a look at how we could centralize this with IDEAglobal HGP object.

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,930
The resource provides us or how we could set up interest centers like this.

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,470
Finally we had a look at Vue resources which allows us to save certain types of requests.

9
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:46,600
Want to send over and over again inconvenient methods we can use and we could also use this as a way

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:53,770
of using templates for our you or else where we can exchange parts of it dynamically based on some data

11
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,860
we could possibly enter ourselves like in the input field here.

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,430
With that we really learned a lot and you saw me mentioned the official documentation from time to time

13
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,920
during this module.

14
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:10,510
I can really encourage you to have a look at it because it is really good.

15
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:15,850
It's not super good documentation but it allows you to have a look at all the options for example something

16
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:20,200
which really doesn't make sense to walk through step by step in a video.

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,570
This is where you can learn how to configure your request your response which dive deeper into this

18
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:32,220
package though to be honest I am very very sure that you have a solid toolset with the things you learned

19
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:38,440
here and it's you're now able to send HTP requests to store your data get your data and all the things

20
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,050
you need in your application.

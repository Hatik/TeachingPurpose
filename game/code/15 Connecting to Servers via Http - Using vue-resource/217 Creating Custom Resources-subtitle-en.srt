00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:07,670
We saw how to use a resource and the last video with default action and Watts is a bit shorter than

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:12,980
this age of the post and then setting up like this we didn't save that much space.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,810
Now it becomes more powerful if you create your own actions.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:22,640
So I will create a new constant custom actions here in the create that hook and be aware you could of

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,330
course also set up these resources here in a more central place and access them on a central object

6
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:34,410
or whatever you like so that you can share it across multiple components.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,300
But here I'll keep it in this one.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,530
So here custom actions are once you create an action which all names safe old for a safe alternative

9
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,990
or something like this and this will now be an object reconfigured this action.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,860
I set up the Mefford.

11
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,440
This shall be post though it will be overwritten to put anyways.

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:03,250
But then it will also set up you are l and I want to have a u r l of all turn active dots Jason instead

13
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,040
of data.

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,010
Jason.

15
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:14,830
Now with that set up I can go up to my submit method here and now I can simply use this though in order

16
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,950
to be able to use my own custom method.

17
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,690
I have to pass new arguments to my resource set up here.

18
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,980
The second argument will be empty.

19
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,900
This would allow me to pass a variable data into Durell.

20
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,880
I'll come back to this soon.

21
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,960
And a third argument are my custom actions.

22
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,550
So this object is set up here which only has one action right now but that's enough.

23
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:42,300
Now with this custom action place I can access my resource again and call save all.

24
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:50,150
The thing and just set up and of course I also pass this user like before but now we should see that

25
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,850
a new node gets created on the back and on firebase.

26
00:01:53,980 --> 00:02:01,270
Well let's try this out by reloading the application entering some data here and submit and on the back

27
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:07,840
end we did see a new node alternative was created and our data is stored here because now we're using

28
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,300
the same old resource here.

29
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,990
And you can hopefully see how it would easily be possible to treat multiple quick resources here with

30
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:22,570
different where else and then use them just like this in different places having a highest degree of

31
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:28,450
flexibility without having to hard code everything over and over again if you remove used the same resource

32
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,740
twice and above resource three times.

33
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,440
While this is how you can easily store it in a central place down there and then simply use it here

34
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,770
on this resource.

1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,560
What you also want to have a look at the response.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,080
Well I'm going to use the same that are here it could push innuendo but generally you can have a look

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,330
at the response by accessing your next function here and passing argument to it.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,300
This argument has is also a function where we will get the response as an argument.

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,740
This is of course automatically provided by the resource and then we can use the response here.

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,420
For example we could change the way response Jason works.

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,040
Let's make our at work again right now and fetch data.

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,400
We're all looping through an array here.

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,180
And that doesn't work anymore because we don't get back in an array.

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,690
Instead we get back an object here where we simply have email and username.

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,230
So no need to loop through all the keys anymore.

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:55,230
There are no multiple keys there aren't any cryptic keys anymore to make this code work again though.

13
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,830
And that is of course a bit of our constructed example here but it shows how to set up such interceptors

14
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:01,730
as well.

15
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,620
So a year we could override the response not just method.

16
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,680
Now be careful about this of course because this will affect all your requests.

17
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:18,330
So you may not really want to do this in your production lab but in a case where you do need to change

18
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,120
certain parts about your response.

19
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:27,510
This is how you can do it so it can override the built in Chaisson method which we use here to extract

20
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,350
the data.

21
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,160
And we need to extract some kind of object again where we can loop through all the keys.

22
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:40,200
So I will basically say this is an function iOS 6 function it is here.

23
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,680
And all I want to do is I want to return a new object where I now have any key let's name it messages

24
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:53,340
so that I have some keys or at least one key here to loop through which is equal to my response body

25
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,770
like this.

26
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,480
This now allows me to extract my response body something in response Chasez would have done normally

27
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,240
but store it in a separate object which has an extra key for that.

28
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,290
So that looping through all the keys and then extracting the user as a value for that key will work

29
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,420
again.

30
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:17,910
So if we have a look at this and now it get data again you now see it works again because now I just

31
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,900
a response chase method.

32
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,680
And this shows you how you can use interceptors to change both your request or your response.

33
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,090
Of course you don't have to change it.

34
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,770
Of course you may only want to change some headers for example.

35
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,310
Maybe you only want to print or log it.

36
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,540
That's totally up to you.

37
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:40,350
This is how you can use interceptors on each request and response and be aware as we do it here.

38
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,630
You can always create your own folders with statements to make sure you check if it's a certain type

39
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,870
of response or a certain type of request and so on.

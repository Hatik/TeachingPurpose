1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:07,650
We're already a good chunk from the Course you'll learn a lot about you chessboards different features

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,030
how to enhance both animations how to use components and much more.

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,950
Now we're nearing the end though.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:21,420
Whilst that is true time wise there are big important chunks of a feature as beauty as offerings years

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,430
to come.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,210
For example HTP until now we were contained in our application.

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,130
We weren't able to reach out to a server though typically in a lot of applications.

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,730
You from time to time need to reach out to a server.

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:40,410
You need to fetch some resource Snee to fetch some data or store some data out there especially when

10
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:46,200
building single page applications something will really dive into in the next Martial's in the last

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,050
motions of course especially when doing that but not limited to this use case you oftentimes need to

12
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,560
make such requests.

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,590
Now a lot of the requests you do make all requests and single page applications as a side note but a

14
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,500
lot of requests in the normal service side application may want to be done.

15
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:09,390
Why are checks which means in the background behind the scenes you don't necessarily want to send the

16
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:16,230
request and get back to page you want to stay on the current page and only reload parts of it or reload

17
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:21,720
some data or store some data while keeping the user on the page and not reloading it in the browser

18
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,760
or navigating to another one.

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,530
This is especially true for a single page applications where the whole purpose is to stay on one single

20
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:28,970
page.

21
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,470
But it's true for other applications too.

22
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:38,960
Therefore in this module we will dive into how we can use HTP or how we can access the web from the

23
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,780
US.

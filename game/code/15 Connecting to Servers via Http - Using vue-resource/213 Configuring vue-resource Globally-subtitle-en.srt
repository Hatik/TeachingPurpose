1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,840
So will learn how to send posts and get requests.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,650
One thing we do right now though is we repeat ourselves here.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,620
We do have you all copied and pasted into each of our functions and you post the get function if we

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,090
were to add more requests or more places where we do these requests.

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,990
We would repeat this Eurail all the time.

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:30,840
Now you are l doesn't change that much though so would be great to have kind of a global place to set

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,780
this up for each HTP request.

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,470
In this application this might of course be different in your application.

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,940
So we actually do have such a central place where we can set up our up location.

10
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,430
You are all or you are all we want to use.

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,040
So I'm going to copy the URL and the place I am talking about is in the manger the chips fall where

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:59,090
we set up our view resource or we add the resource to our instance here after adding it with the you

13
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,860
use I can call you HTP.

14
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,500
And now important with outhaul are assigned dollar sign is only needed when accessing it from inside

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,590
your view instance if you access it on the global view object then this is without a dollar sign.

16
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:19,710
And here we can set up some Global Options again to learn more about these Global Options dive into

17
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,940
the official view resource documentation.

18
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:30,540
And there you will find the API docs where you can learn more about which options you can set where

19
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,210
and how to configure it at all.

20
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:39,930
Now what I can show you here is you got access to the root key on your Global Options and the root key

21
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,580
basically just is your main You are all you're going to use.

22
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:52,140
So by setting up this all requests will be sent to you well and then in your methods you can simply

23
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,840
append things to that Ural.

24
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,260
For example nothing because the euro already includes everything I need.

25
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,020
But if you had some other service and then you have some supper out like send data or something like

26
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,120
that then you could append and like this or Again if you are a cumbrous everything you need just send

27
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,610
the empty string.

28
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:17,300
Now with this set up you will see if I now reload this and get data again it still works.

29
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:24,210
But now we have a central place where it is stored and you can set up our things to on this global view

30
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:24,910
object.

31
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:31,560
For example you could also set up some default headers here if you needed that if you wanted to set

32
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,390
the content type for each request or something like that.

33
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:41,010
That can all be done under colonial view HTP object here on the options object I should say and that

34
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,130
is a convenient way of centralizing certain things which are always equal.

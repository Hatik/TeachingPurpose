1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:08,380
Did you ever wonder why you resource is called view resource and not view HTP or something like that

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,310
because it has a nice extra feature which allows us to set up our own resources which are kind of nice

3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:22,200
mappings of common tasks to HTP requests for example you want to store something in the database.

4
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:29,530
Typically it would be it would make sense if you would call save a Save method on your data and then

5
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,930
that would automatically execute a POST request or send the post request to the right.

6
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,200
You are all with the data attached to it.

7
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:42,340
Now the resource or the resources you can set up with new resource allow you to do that.

8
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:48,630
I'll go to the app did you fall and I want to show you this concept of view resources.

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,130
The first thing you've got to do is you have to create such resources if you want to use them for data

10
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,810
store and you have a new key here in my data.

11
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:05,350
In my view instance an named resource and there's just an empty object then I will set up the created

12
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,780
lifecycle look because that is a good place to initialize the resources.

13
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,560
What I use in this episode.

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:19,240
View file here and then I simply can set it up by using my resource property had just created and then

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:25,270
accessing this dollar sign resource again dollar sign indicates it's not coming from us it's coming

16
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,990
from the route or phone from you.

17
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,660
Yes in general or in this case from view resource in general and view resource actually is a method

18
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,760
to this method.

19
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,410
We have to pass certain data fields.

20
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,650
The first field is the resource.

21
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,890
Now that could be data.

22
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,560
Jason does will again use our route.

23
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,130
You are always set up here.

24
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,210
And well we already have data adjacent there.

25
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:58,460
So to make this work I will remove it here so that we just have it like this.

26
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:04,600
And then in my laptop you file user data Chaisson and also using all my above requests as the first

27
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,080
argument.

28
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,990
Now so that we append data adjacent at the end of this standard Eurail you will see in the next one

29
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,260
just why I do that.

30
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,630
For now I will leave it static like this.

31
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:18,520
So for data wouldn't have needed to do that but you will see why it did in the next two days again.

32
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,800
So here dessous the payoff to your L-1 to visit with this resource.

33
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,340
I'm going to leave this like it is right for now.

34
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,640
We will change this in the next lecture's.

35
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,040
Then it will make sense that extract that this data chase and fall from the Urooj euro.

36
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:39,820
And with that we already set up some resources because the resource ships with some default actions

37
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,320
we can perform on our resources on our data.

38
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,400
You can check out these default actions in the resource documentation.

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,170
Of course if you go to creating resources you will see some default actions here.

40
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,280
So let's use that resource we just created.

41
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,810
How does this work.

42
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,360
I will comment out my submit code in here.

43
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:12,070
So this old code and instead and I want to submit this differently I want to use this resource using

44
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:19,480
my own resource property here which I configured down there and then save because save is one of the

45
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,500
default actions provided by the resource.

46
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,870
As you can see here this will as you can also see send a post request to do your all which has saved

47
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,740
for this resource this is this you are appended to the root you are l of course.

48
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:42,970
And then we can simply pass the data as an argument here because if we can pass two things the first

49
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,290
one.

50
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:49,710
Are any parameters we want to pass to to you or else we won't do that for now and we'll come back later.

51
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:56,790
The second argument is that I actually want to pass the data I do want to pass is this user ASP for

52
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:04,290
with my I'm supposed to QUEST Well with this let me save this and send this request again.

53
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,210
And let's see if this works.

54
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,240
And by going to the firebase console looks good.

55
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,600
Now let me try this again.

56
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,320
Looks good it is over it because yes we send a post request but we still have our interest central in

57
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,010
place.

58
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:23,030
But now we're using these resource here as you can see to send texts now.

59
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:28,140
Shorter though of course all because I removed the functions which it could still use.

60
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,360
But with that we can now set up some flexible pieces of functions we can then reuse in our application

61
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:40,000
and it will come back to this and now customized is a bit more in the next video.

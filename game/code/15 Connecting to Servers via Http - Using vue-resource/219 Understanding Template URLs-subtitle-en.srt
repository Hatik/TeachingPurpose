1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,070
Now that we learn about resources and so on it's all the time to learn about how we can make our Eurail

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:17,190
more flexible at say for example here right now we always have data that Jason hardcoded in here.

3
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,740
Now what if we wanted to replace this dynamically then we could simply wrap it and call the braces and

4
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,780
name it node for example.

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,040
And now this is a variable.

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,260
We can replace all leave everything as it is here.

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,480
Do you LS set up here will override at forward the saving action.

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,880
But now for getting well-baby I want to get it from the alternative or the data node.

9
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,330
So it would be nice if I could exchange this.

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:52,140
Therefore I will add a new input field above my Get Data button input type form class form control type

11
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,280
text of course and then some line breaks to separated from the button.

12
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:04,950
And then here I want to bind with the model to a node property which of course add here and which should

13
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,870
be data by default.

14
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,990
Now I want a user to be able to enter any note here.

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,750
And of course only if it exists.

16
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:18,600
Will the HCB request that then be sent to this and point and fetch data from there.

17
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:25,410
So to achieve this we somehow need to change the way we fetch our data and make this more flexible.

18
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,800
No I will use a resource for this again.

19
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,260
So here all I will do is I will say Get data.

20
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:41,280
For example this shell have a method of get and now view resource generally supports the set up of your.

21
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,230
You're out as templates.

22
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,240
So with flexible parts like this here if you want to learn more.

23
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,960
Again a great start is on The View resource.

24
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:57,960
Get her page and then they're under on the route page actually you will find is your templates link

25
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:05,580
which will take you to this page here which basically describes as you are template standard which explains

26
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:12,120
you how you can set up flexible pieces in your view or else which may be exchanged at all of the features

27
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,420
described here will work with you resource.

28
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,350
Now we're using these symbols use case here where we simply have a variable thing in you or all that

29
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,780
which we can exchange for some real data.

30
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,050
So this case here on the documentation here.

31
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,820
But more interesting this case here in our code.

32
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,820
So we need to replace this node variable dynamically.

33
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,830
Now we can do this.

34
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:41,240
I'm going to replace my HTP request here in fecche data.

35
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,870
And instead I now also want to use this resource and now it gets data at this new resource adjusts it

36
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:49,680
up.

37
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,840
Now get data that doesn't have it's own you are also using the default Eurail and you could have used

38
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,910
this with D.

39
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,160
This he gets request as well.

40
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:04,710
Just as a side note but you're in this resource you were always set up for all resources we do have

41
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,500
a flexible piece in our Eurail node.

42
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:14,910
Now we can override this by simply passing an object as the first argument where we then specify each

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,540
variable we do have an hour.

44
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:22,920
You are all so Note for example as a key and then as a value the value which should really be entered

45
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,860
into you will.

46
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:30,550
Once it is sent Does this year this node referring to our node property where we store the user input.

47
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:36,600
So what this will do is it will take our you are all down there and replace the note key with this value

48
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,680
we set up here.

49
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:43,350
And if we would have multiple pieces here like with a slash and then and number of pieces that we could

50
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,570
simply add a number here and replace this to and so on.

51
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:52,600
And you can again consult the page I showed you before to learn more about how you can structure this

52
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,780
and which operators and so on you have in your toolset.

53
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,650
So this will now replace this note part.

54
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:06,950
Here with this value we pass here and then we could also pass our arguments but we don't need to it's

55
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,760
a get request so that looks fine.

56
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,760
Now of course we here again want to use then.

57
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,500
And basically I want to use the same code as before.

58
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:23,400
So we're just going to copy that because that code will work fine and all in to do is uncomment is of

59
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,200
course and with this emplace this should now work well.

60
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:33,810
It's the same functionality as before but now with our own resource which has the great advantage of

61
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,380
being flexible.

62
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,940
So let me reload the page and get the data.

63
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,490
And we see it worked when we fetch it from data.

64
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:49,270
Now let's fetch from the alternative node by entering alternative and your looks good.

65
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:54,630
And this is where I want to conclude this section because now we really learn a lot.

66
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:01,790
And this is the final piece where you have the ability to exchange pieces into your l.

67
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,440
You are sending your request to.

1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,530
So we installed the resource we set it up to be usable though we don't use it yet.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,560
Now in order to be able to use it we also need some server where we can send our data to right because

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,660
we want to reach out to the web so we probably need some server on the web where we can store our data

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,830
or we can fetch data.

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,270
Now the bad thing is setting up such a server on our own is a little bit too much work for this course.

6
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:33,190
The great thing is there are services we can easily leverage now use firebase for this.

7
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:40,050
So you may simply google for firebase again and then it's firebase not cool calm and a service by Google

8
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:46,480
which you may test freely check out their official pages to learn more how long it is free and what

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,360
it will cost you something in the end.

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:56,370
But the things we're going to do here are free and then you basically need to well sign up or get to

11
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,700
your console if you already Arsen up and I will quickly do this and then meet you in this firebase console

12
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,370
where you are able to create new projects.

13
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,370
So I'm now in the firebase console and here you can create new firebase projects.

14
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,810
And what is firebase to begin with.

15
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:20,640
Firebase is something or a service you can use as the back end for your native app for your web app.

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,330
It has database functionality.

17
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,120
It has authentication functionality and much more.

18
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,120
Definitely check out the official box to learn how it works what it has what it costs and so on.

19
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,730
There is no firebase tutorial.

20
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,810
I'm only using it as it is a simple back and for our HTP tests here.

21
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:45,060
So to create such a back and click on Create project and then I'll give it any name of well my or your

22
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,050
choice.

23
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,620
Pick your country and create the project.

24
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:55,440
This will once it is created take you to your project dashboard and on this dashboard you got a lot

25
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,250
of different things like you can store set up storage for files and other things.

26
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:07,620
Now for showing how HTP works I will only use the database because our own only want to store data in

27
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,790
the database here.

28
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:14,100
Now the first important thing you got to do for the testing year only for the testing is that on the

29
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,320
rules in the database section you should said read and write both to truth so that everyone is able

30
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,850
to read and write so that we don't have to authenticate ourselves published this and then you should

31
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,830
be able to access this without problems.

32
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,420
Now keep in mind these are not the settings you want to have in a production app.

33
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,380
And again you definitely need to dive into the documentation if you want to use firebase for a production

34
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:34,690
app.

35
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,210
This is only for testing.

36
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:43,660
Now this will allow us to write to this database which already looks like a bird like Mongo database

37
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,480
so like Mongo D-B for example where we have key value pairs though right now it is empty.

38
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,690
This year is going to be all we need to access though.

39
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:58,290
And in order to be able to access it I will go back to my applet view file and the first thing I want

40
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,360
to do is I want to be able to store some data there.

41
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:07,770
So we're going to set this up now and the next video then we'll actually send this request so to store

42
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:13,410
it all quickly set up a div with a class for in groups or this bootstrap class terrible have a label

43
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:21,270
where is a user name and then they're offering my input with class form and control which is of type

44
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:26,080
text where I want to enter my user name and then I'm simply going to copy those.

45
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:35,790
Once you're you also set up something for let's say your email address type text as well and then a

46
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:44,760
button type button button primary where I say submit and then I'll go down to my view object your are

47
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,090
two of you instant set up my data.

48
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,740
I want to use and it is data here.

49
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:58,020
I want to have the same two fields that I want to have username and email though I will group it together

50
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,640
in a user object.

51
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:06,270
So hirable have a user name empty at the beginning and email empty at the beginning and then we'll learn

52
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:13,080
how to bind this with we model of where I will now bind to use or drug user name and on my email I will

53
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,140
bind to user dot email of course.

54
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:24,480
Now that I'm able to submit some data and you well send it well almost though I of course also need

55
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,510
to set up my methods where I will say submit and here for an hour will simply log in to the console

56
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:36,840
log my user year and that ad to click on the button here and execute submit.

57
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,360
Now let's see this in the running application just to see if everything works before then in the next

58
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,080
module.

59
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:52,590
I will actually use this to send some data and yet this does not work because there should be this user.

60
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:59,610
And then if I had over a hoodie application and I enter some data here test that test dot com and open

61
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:06,450
up the console we see now that the user view gets printed with email and user name fields the center

62
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,410
here is just added by chairs to be able to listen to changes to that.

63
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,960
But here we see the field we set up with the values we entered.

64
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,110
So this looks good with dad.

65
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,520
We set up our application.

66
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,600
We set up firebase.

67
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,110
Let's now use all the things we set up here to actually send the request.

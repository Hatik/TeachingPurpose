1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,260
Not you conclude this part and ends.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,790
Let's answer one important question.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:13,540
Is the data here this object the fruit mix and is this object actually shared between the components

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,940
which added or not.

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,120
Because right now of course we share the methods and so on.

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:24,310
But if we change the data something we don't do right now we only have to compute a property we don't

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,730
change the original data.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,180
If we change this.

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:33,610
Is this reflected in all components or is a new instance of this object created for each component very

10
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,120
Pastis Maxine.

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,580
Now let's find out by adding something in our Apter view file.

12
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:47,620
Let's simply add a new button here above our list where I say add new item.

13
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:57,270
Now all I want to do here is on click is I want to access my fruit's I can not not with this though.

14
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:03,850
I know I can do that because I get it added with the mix in this area here fruits and I want to push

15
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,910
a new item on it and the new item symbol.

16
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,540
It simply is Berrys.

17
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:20,420
No one is safe this let's see if both lists get adjusted or only the first one you see various are only

18
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,160
added to the first list.

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,090
So this object this fruit makes in is not shared.

20
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,500
It's not the same place in memory which we then use as a mixin and seperate components.

21
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,760
Instead it is really replicated.

22
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:39,800
So each component which gets this as it makes in gets a fresh copy of this object and we're not sharing

23
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,400
one.

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,280
This means it's safe for you to access the data unmanipulated without affecting other places in your

25
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,340
application.

26
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,240
If you want to affect Arald places in your application consider simply using something like event bus.

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,730
I show you all here in the last module about components where you would use a view instance which you

28
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:05,360
then basically can access on your application to call method Stehr or also change the data stored there.

29
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,880
This would be an option or you could of course also use a normal javascript object which you just import

30
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:18,470
not add as a mixin but just use in your code like this fruit makes an and then access the fields there.

31
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,440
This is how you can use the same component.

32
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:27,230
Excuse me the same object if you use the mix in aere you chaps will create a copy for you so that you

33
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,980
can safely edited and don't influence other components.

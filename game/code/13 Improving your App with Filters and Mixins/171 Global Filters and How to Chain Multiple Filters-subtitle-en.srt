00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:07,240
So in the last lecture we learned how to treat a local folder with the folders property and our view

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,600
instance or view component and how to use it with the pipe symbol there.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:17,230
You also learned that we need to pass a value and return to transform value important again that only

4
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,290
transforms the value that we see are in the template.

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,240
It doesn't transform the data property it solves so it doesn't transform text.

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,620
It only transforms the output.

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,280
That's important to understand.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,720
Now that let's create a global filter here.

9
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:35,470
I already have a name to lowercase and there we want to pass the function as the second argument which

10
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:39,150
should get executed here of course we also get the value.

11
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:45,350
And here I want to return the value to whip's to lower case like this.

12
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,330
So it does the opposite of the uppercase folder with this folder set up.

13
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,100
I want to use it.

14
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:55,080
And now I can also show you how to change faulter as I can simply add another pipe.

15
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:00,660
Now this folder here will then use all the content in front of it as an input.

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:08,480
So the text transform to uppercase is now a new value passed to two lowercase year.

17
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,310
Now let's save this.

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,470
And we see now it's all lowercase because now the following happens.

19
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:20,380
I pass text to uppercase there it gets transformed to be all uppercase letters.

20
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,040
And then I take this result and pass it to two lowercase.

21
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,730
There it gets transform to be all lower case letters which is what we see here.

22
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:35,830
And that really is it that are folder's does this is how we create our own folders both Clovelly here

23
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:42,490
and locally here with the folders property how we pass value how we returned and how we can change them.

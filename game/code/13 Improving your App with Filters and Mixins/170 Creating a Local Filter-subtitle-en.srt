1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:10,930
Now what is a palter a filter is basically a little syntax feature you can use your template to transform

2
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,950
some output in the template.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,110
And that is important.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,350
A filter helps you transform output in the data.

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:23,620
It doesn't transform the data itself it only transforms what the user is see as a typical example and

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:29,680
actually a folder we will build is a folder which takes and put a string let's say and turns it all

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:37,180
to uppercase letters important future S doesn't ship with built in filters and therefore all the folders

8
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,910
we need have to be both on our own.

9
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,930
I will show you how to build such a filter now and thereafter.

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:49,690
I'll also show you an alternative to folders and explain WHY DOES alternative times may be the better

11
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,870
choice but let's start with building our own fault tree.

12
00:00:53,300 --> 00:01:01,960
So I want to build a Voltar So let's say here in my application here I have some data and in this data

13
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,650
of course I returned my data object as always in this object.

14
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:10,330
I get some text when output this text could be simply b.

15
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,380
Hello there.

16
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,820
Now what I want to do is I want to output this text here.

17
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,330
And of course I can use string interpolation Forder without having double curly braces and with my server

18
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,390
running we see Hello.

19
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,080
They're not too spectacular has nothing to do with folders.

20
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,940
Now I want to turn this text to be all uppercase.

21
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,330
Important thing is I don't want to make it uppercase in the state property itself text should stay as

22
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,140
it is.

23
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:44,130
I want to give it back in the uppercase for in the template only for that we will create a folder and

24
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:51,100
we do create such a folder by adding the folders property here to our object.

25
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,380
This will create a new faulter which we can use in this component's template.

26
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,130
Important.

27
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:02,130
This will register this folder locally so it can actually only be used in this template and the template

28
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:09,920
of this component of this instance you can of course also register a filter globally with a view filter.

29
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:14,990
Now if you were just of globally you have as a first argument the name of the folder.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,350
Let's name it to lowercase for example.

31
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,350
And I will work on this in a second.

32
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:28,520
And here in our local filter we have the key as the name for the folder.

33
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,680
I'll name it to uppercase.

34
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:36,060
So like this maybe to uppercase of course would have also used the camel case and text with all the

35
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,370
four components.

36
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:44,050
And now of FOTR is only a function and we can use such a string key name for a function.

37
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:50,200
Again the alternative would be to use to uppercase like this.

38
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:57,990
Now this function here always gets a value Asti input the value will be the data we want to transform

39
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:03,000
and it will show you how to pass the data there in a second but be aware that each filter will get a

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,770
value because that is what folder's.

41
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:11,630
Therefore transform some data that value can then be used to do any operation on it.

42
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:16,710
And then the end we have to return the transformed value or could be the same value if you don't want

43
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,400
to do anything but then the filter are that useful.

44
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,410
So here I want to simply say return value to uppercase.

45
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,480
This will turn it to all being uppercase to all characters being uppercase and will return the update

46
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,530
value.

47
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:38,020
I can then use this folder in this template since it is a local folder by adding the pipe symbol here.

48
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,030
This might resemble or two pipes if you know English too and it works very much the same.

49
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,650
And then a fault or name.

50
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,650
So here there would be two uppercase like that for example.

51
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,760
Now with this register here I can now hit save.

52
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:00,540
And we see Hello there in all uppercase and now with that we created our own fault or this is how easy

53
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,690
it is just the function getting a value and returning the transformed value.

54
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,040
It gets the value automatically because we added here with the pipe symbol and that will give you chance

55
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:18,190
to take the piece in front of the pipe and put it or pass it as a value to dysfunction to the apprecate

56
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,410
function.

57
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,310
That is why we create such a folder.

58
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:27,520
Let me next show you how you create a global folder how to register globally as we do here.

59
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,970
And then how to change multiple folders.

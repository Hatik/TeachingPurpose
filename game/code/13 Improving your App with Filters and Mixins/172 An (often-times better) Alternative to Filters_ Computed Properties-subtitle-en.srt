1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:08,110
Know when to use folders like this it seems very useful and that is we can use it to transform certain

2
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:08,920
outputs.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,560
Think about formatting a date by putting let's say a date folder which you create your own where you

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,320
then are able to configure the date or how it should be displayed.

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:24,850
But oftentimes you think that a folder might solve a certain solution and there is a better alternative

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,020
a way lable and that would be a computed property.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,120
Let me show you an example.

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,870
Imagine we have an array of fruits here.

9
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,260
Now there we may happen Apple.

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,510
We may have a banana and we may have a mango.

11
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,050
Hope that is to name and a Malen.

12
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:53,210
So we've got four fruit items there now it would be convenient to now be able to have it output as a

13
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,460
list here and then FELTER when we type in the input field.

14
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:03,980
So let's do this all at a horizontal line on the input where I want to blind to or with we model to

15
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:07,260
the folder Text property which I'll also create.

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,320
So here we got faulter text which is empty at the beginning.

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:19,860
And with that filtered text here I want to filter does an ordered list where I loop with we 4 and loop

18
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,010
for my root in fruit's like this.

19
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,020
This allows me to output fruit here.

20
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,780
Now we have a look at what we see of course is our four fruits that is normal.

21
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:36,620
Future has killed us but learned we're not using any folders here now would be convenient to somehow

22
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:45,410
add a folder here to say only output these fruits which match our filtered text so if we entered in

23
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:50,520
there we only want the added fruit which starts with the Amlet say so but that we mean to say.

24
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,080
And then here this filter somehow pipe filter after fruits.

25
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:01,620
Now the issue of such a faulter is that this is very safe optimal from a performance perspective you

26
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:07,340
chances not able to handle this greatly in the background as it is not able to detect when it should

27
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,680
rerun the fault or not actually it will rerun the folder up on each rendering of the dawn.

28
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,560
This of course is a huge performance hit because maybe you didn't change there's input here but still

29
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,550
it needs to rerun the Voltar because it doesn't know that.

30
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,360
So this really is bad for performance.

31
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:31,160
Hence floaters have been kind of limited in what they can do in view chess 2.0 that was different in

32
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,630
Bucharest 1.0 as a side note.

33
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,430
So what could we do in such a case where we want to fold an existing list we can use a computer property

34
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,790
we already learned about these early on the course.

35
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:49,520
The great thing about computer properties is viewed as knows what such a property depends and therefore

36
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,200
only recalculates it.

37
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:56,630
If something changes in the things we can use and those properties were in this method it is then in

38
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,370
the end.

39
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,880
So let me demonstrate this here.

40
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:09,430
I want to add a new property faltered fruit's this is actually a methadose or do properties are and

41
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,710
you're a one to return my roots IRET.

42
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:18,860
And since it is an array I can call the faulter method on this iOS 6 method the folder method.

43
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:24,910
Now take cycle back which is executed on each element into cerate the element is then passed automatically

44
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,480
as an argument to this callback.

45
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:32,770
Now in this cold case I have to return all them elements and when I keep in this new area I'm generating

46
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,350
this folder fruits array that is it is a method.

47
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:40,300
But keep in mind behind the scenes view cheapass will treat a property based on this method which is

48
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:46,600
then recreated whenever some input changes so whenever fruit's changes or as it will soon implemented

49
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,160
filter text.

50
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,650
So here I want to return each element which matches this faulter text.

51
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,310
So the text entry per user does computer property will only be recalculated a folder or text or fruit's

52
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,420
changes.

53
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,290
Therefore it's very performant.

54
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:11,640
It's not doing any unnecessary calculations and I can simply loop through my filtered fruits here.

55
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,130
That's a great alternative to a filter.

56
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:21,670
Now if we have a look this still works but if I enter M for mango or Mallan we only see these two if

57
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:27,100
I enter a free app and we only see this if I have a lowercase a we see banana and mango because these

58
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,660
two have a lowercase.

59
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:36,460
If I now enter a and we see only banana and mango because these are the only two words which have a

60
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,270
and character sequence in them.

61
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,450
So this shows you how to create a bad or faulter with view chairs.

62
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,660
This is not using View chess folders at all.

63
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,570
We do that with the uppercase folder but for more complex transformations you want to use a computer

64
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,200
property and that is something to keep in mind.

65
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:59,360
Folders can be a nice solution but oftentimes computer properties are the better solution.

66
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,970
They can be more fine tuned to your needs and they are more performant.

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,110
So keep this in mind when working with folders.

68
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:12,070
You may of course use the normal filter here but again definitely think about using a computed property

69
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:12,920
instead.

1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:08,460
Let's stick to this example and let's say I want to have a data or does data object here as well as

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,730
does compute property faltered fruit's in both my list and my app don't you file for this.

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:21,840
I will create such a mix and show we want to outsource all that code into such a mix in and here all

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,930
create a new fall in the source folder What's all that which I'll name fruit mix in DOD.

5
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:33,500
J.S. name is truly up to you and they're able export a constant fruit mix in the name which she was

6
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,670
and that's what we had Shabbas script object which holds all the data.

7
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,940
It's shust copied or kept from my component.

8
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:46,080
Now with that I can go back to my list here and I want to import this newly created mix in which I export

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,630
there.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,170
So I import that from my fruit mix in file.

11
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,480
And the thing I want to import of course my fruit makes in.

12
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:01,850
And now I can simply replace the data here with the mix ins property on that instance which is an array

13
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,160
where I specify all the mix in all the code snippets I want to add to this instance.

14
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:13,670
Now if I save this and navigate back to the app you'll see this still works ask for it.

15
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:20,090
But now we're sharing this code which also means I can now go to my app or the view file and here I

16
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:25,760
get all of my text in the data field so I'm not completely removing it Mullaly removing fruits and this

17
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:36,470
and remove the computed property here and now here I will also import this fruit mix in I just created

18
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:45,740
from the from the fruit mix in file I just created this one here and I will add mix ins here to the

19
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,000
fruit mix in.

20
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,540
If I save this and reload Let's all the Riady up here.

21
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,030
You see it still works in my Apter you fall again.

22
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,910
And interesting enough here we still have the data property.

23
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:04,970
So even though we mix in a new one we can clearly see as we see the string up here still exists that

24
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,620
future as cleverly merges our mix in a. already existing data.

25
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,760
In our app that view follow or in any instance where we add a mix in.

26
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,870
So that's how we generally create and use mix ins.

27
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:23,080
Let me dive into that merging process and some really interesting things about mix ins.

1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:07,850
Thus far we saw that we register mix ins in the components where we want to use them with the mix every

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:08,370
year.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,560
Of course you could add multiple mix in.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,660
That is also important to know.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,890
Now let's say you got one mix in you want to use on every single instance in your app.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,370
And this is really important to understand a global mix is added to every instance and thus every component

7
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,800
too in your application.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,100
Hence you rarely want to use that.

9
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,950
Most of the time that is what the official UTSA docs recommend.

10
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,060
You want to use this if you create third party plug ins for the future.

11
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,370
And not in your production application.

12
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,710
Nonetheless to show you how it would work.

13
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:47,120
You can register a global Ricksen by typing view mixed in.

14
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,390
Now that will allow you to configure some code which is mixed into every single instance.

15
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:59,120
Therefore we here passed the object which is our mix in and let's say I again add something to recreate

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,710
that hook.

17
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:07,330
So now again I manage to re adjust my Create talk here in a mix and now in the global mix in here I

18
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:15,180
want to say global mix in create a hook so that we can see where this is coming from.

19
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,560
Right now safe to say I don't need to add a to any array because again it is already added to all instances.

20
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:28,330
If y clear days and reload we see that the global makes and gets executed here then we have created

21
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,610
then the global mix and again and then created an inside list create hook.

22
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:39,550
Now why do we have global mix in three times when we only have the Epcot view file and the list view

23
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,460
file here.

24
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,410
Well because we also have the main dodgiest fall.

25
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,080
Here we have a new instance.

26
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:54,200
So we get the created talk execute and a new instance that does first call then let's have a look.

27
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,330
We get the render function will be rendered on file.

28
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,250
So this is the second time we call the created talk.

29
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:07,410
Then the call created because the app that you file also has the fruit makes in which adds d created

30
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:13,420
hook here and then we reached the third time that we call the global makes and create a hook because

31
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,400
now we also add the list component.

32
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:23,350
This is the last thing we add in our application and there we have the fruit mix and edit which is called

33
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:30,640
first then the local created method here which says inside list created took this last and then were

34
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,350
done.

35
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:39,570
So this is lifecycle global mix called first then mix is added with the mixdowns array called next.

36
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:47,350
And then code directly written into the insense instance is handled Lastly so that data always has the

37
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,810
last word as described before.

38
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,970
This is how you can add such a low mix in again used with caution.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,870
It really affects everything.

40
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,960
Dessous why you typically use it for developing like ins where you don't really have a complete app

41
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,210
with many many components and instances but a contained piece of business logic which you then shipped

42
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,720
to other apps where your global mixing is contained to your business logic.

43
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,330
But to be aware of how to use it this is how you would use it.

44
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:21,260
Typically though you use a local mix in with the mix array and then he implored where he makes in this

45
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,460
outsourced in a separate file for example.

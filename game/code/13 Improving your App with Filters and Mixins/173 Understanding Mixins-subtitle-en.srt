1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:08,090
Know you might recognize one problem let's say I would have another component and I'll quickly create

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:15,920
one I'll name it list view because all I want to have in there is basically a copy of my app view file.

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,510
I want to have my fruits in there too.

4
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:25,460
I will remove the uppercase thing here I don't need that and I will remove my folder here and therefore

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,840
but it still will have my data don't need to text but I need the fruits the filtered text and then my

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:41,680
filtered fruits down there and then in the app you file I want to import data so I can import list from

7
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:47,970
my list view file and register it as a local component here as we'll learn it before.

8
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,550
Thus far nothing new.

9
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,460
So let me quickly do this.

10
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:57,700
My app list component list is team or dead file or Marchal year.

11
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,630
And then I can simply attach it below my list.

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,640
I have my app list where of the selector I just specified.

13
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,080
If I do this we see the second list.

14
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,300
OK that's a bit ugly.

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,800
Because of the styling.

16
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,000
So let me quickly get rid of all this thing you say.

17
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:18,550
All these things here should keep one surrounding death here you though.

18
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,520
So let's quickly do that.

19
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,400
Re-ordered this.

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,330
Nice.

21
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,660
Now it looks much better.

22
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:28,580
Now we get this duplication here and as you can see of course this works too.

23
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,300
It's not connected to the first folder and it shouldn't be.

24
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,630
But now I get to folders lists.

25
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,020
The problem we have here of course is code duplication.

26
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:43,930
We have computed property here and there data fields here and also in the apt view file.

27
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:50,830
Now a filter normal filter registered globally lets say would have allowed us to solve this issue because

28
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:55,720
we registered it globally and then we can use it everywhere and hence we don't duplicate the code but

29
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:01,660
we just learned that folders aren't that good to be used and are also limited in their capability.

30
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,500
How can we avoid such a code duplication.

31
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:09,970
And of course we not only faced this when using faulter as duplicate code is something we'll often see.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,670
Sometimes we just want to have some code or some data what you want to share amongst multiple instances

33
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,660
or components for dead.

34
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,360
We got mix ins and I will have a look at this now.

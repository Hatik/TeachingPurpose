1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:10,080
With that we covered what mix ins are how we can use them to share some code and to avoid code duplication

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,650
across components.

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,970
You saw that you can add all the features you have in a normal instance like lifecycle hooks the data

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,650
property computer properties of course you could also share methods.

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,840
You also learn that you can add a global mix and but do that with caution and you've learned that you

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,060
get a separate copy of this mix in each component you added.

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:38,670
You also learn how it is merged together in case that you're setting some Dator or methods here in the

8
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,560
mix in that you also use in your component value added.

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,510
Now the form extends.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:51,090
You also had a look at folders you look at how to build folders with the view folder command or by registering

11
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,770
them locally with the folders property.

12
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:00,870
You'll learn how to transform data output in the template but also that there are some limitations and

13
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,450
that you want to consider computer properties for more complex operations so that they don't get run

14
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,460
all the time.

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:14,290
Overall you want to use folders Israeli use computer properties instead and use mix ins to share them.

16
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,890
And with that I think we really really covered a lot.

17
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,020
We covered a lot of the core features beauteous offers us.

18
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,520
And next I want to dive into animations making our web a little bit more beautiful with some nice transitions

19
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,870
and animations before we don't really go into the more advanced stuff like accessing HTP.

20
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,720
So reaching out to a server using routeing to really create a single page application getting a better

21
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,120
state management with view X to be able to build bigger applications.

22
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,170
And then finally to bolt our final application and deploy everything.

23
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,250
I can't wait.

24
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,060
So let's start.

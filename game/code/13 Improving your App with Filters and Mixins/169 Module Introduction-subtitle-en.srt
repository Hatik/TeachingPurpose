Welcome to a new module after learning about directives for rooms components and the view chairs templates

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:17,600
and text in general I now want to dive into to average nice features future as officers which in some

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,660
cases can be really helpful filters and mix in.

4
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:28,190
Now both topics still pick up for its own course module because it will see we can walk through it pretty

5
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:28,840
fast.

6
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,950
That doesn't mean that they're worthless.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,930
Not at all.

8
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:38,570
You will see that filters used rightly as well as Mexicans can really help you structure your app and

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,980
output content in the way you want output.

10
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,920
I want to start with Salter's.

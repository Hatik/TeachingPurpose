00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:08,330
So Overton's module we added a lot of features which are typical to user authentication.

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:16,250
All of them running in our view application we got this token which we fetch which we get when signing

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:22,760
up and signing in which we store in both Buick's and the more persistent local storage we get all the

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,040
log out and log in functionality.

5
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:32,090
We got a UI that takes our authentication status into account by updating the header and blocking access

6
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,280
to dashboard if we're not offene catered.

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:42,350
And with that we got a lot of useful features implemented into our application into our demo application

8
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,120
here.

9
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:48,200
Now feel free to play around with that and enhance it adjust to your needs.

10
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:54,920
And of course added to your next project because these are all powerful and very interesting features

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,880
which you might need in a lot of web apps you're building.

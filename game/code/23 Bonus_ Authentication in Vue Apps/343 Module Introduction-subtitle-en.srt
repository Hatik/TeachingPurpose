Welcome to this module authentication is something which plays an important role in almost any web application

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,620
authentication.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:20,040
Also to a great deal happens on the backend on the server and therefore is not really relevant to you.

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:28,530
Yes but there actually is something special about authentication and single page applications.

5
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,620
And that again is where View comes in.

6
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:40,230
We won't focus on validating user passwords on the server sending confirmation emails or storing data

7
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,480
in the database because that all happens on the server.

8
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,210
And that of course greatly depends on the kind of service or language you're using.

9
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,260
Are you using ph p.m.-I sequel or are you using node and Mongo D-B node.

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,810
In my sequel whatever it is this is something a dedicated node HP and so on Klores should teach you

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:07,830
but I will show you how to add all indication to the Front-End how to get a so-called token more about

12
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:13,440
this in the next lecture from the back at how to store and manage that token how to integrate it with

13
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:19,230
us how to protect route's against unwanted excess and much more.

14
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:26,100
So this is the goal of this Marchal show you how to integrate off indication as a Demel back and I will

15
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:32,400
use firebase for the reasons I mentioned a few seconds ago about how you need to adjust back at depending

16
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,850
on the server side language with firebase authentication is easy but it actually gives us exactly the

17
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,940
API we would have with any cost of back end to.

18
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:50,430
So what I show you here does not only work with firebase but with any back and now how however does

19
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,350
authentication don't work.

20
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,850
That is super important and something I will explain in the next lecture.

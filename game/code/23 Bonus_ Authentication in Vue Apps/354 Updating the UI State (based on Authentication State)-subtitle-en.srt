1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,390
In the last lecture we added Raut protection.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,830
Now of course it would also be nice to not even show a link to that route if we can go there.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,400
So I need to adjust what output in the header.

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,530
Depending on the off state.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,480
Now that's super simple.

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,640
Let's go to the store.

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:24,470
First of all and let's add a new Geter and their own name it is authenticated.

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:31,260
You can choose any name you want is indicated as a method as all getters which receives the state and

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:45,910
they simply return the result of a very trivial check all see if state ID token is equal to no not equal

10
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:46,240
to nil.

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:52,080
I mean if it's not equal to NULL we are offene get it because then we have a token.

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,190
So that is why the return is authentic it is a getter.

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,730
I can now use in my head a component there I'll add my script Tex.

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:10,750
Export the default object and add a computed property to map my Geter to some property I can use in

15
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,360
the header component here.

16
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,600
I will name it off.

17
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,420
You can change any name you want.

18
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:24,190
It's a method as all computer properties and I will return the result of this reach out to the store

19
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:33,580
gatherer's and there reach out to this new is offene hated Gadar we just added a second ago as all getters

20
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,870
don't executed as a function.

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,690
Use it as a property.

22
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,900
X will do the rest.

23
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:46,840
So now we get this is often we get information from the store in the header we can now use is off property

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,510
which disinformation is mapped to to only rendered the links we want to render.

25
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:59,290
So for sign up we can use AVF to only render this if we're not often the case that because signing up

26
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:07,270
only makes sense if we're not of indicated the same foresight in we if not off is the right check here

27
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,660
for that dashboard on the average hand.

28
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,250
I want to check if we are authentic.

29
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:16,320
So does is what I don't map with this.

30
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,520
If I go back to my application and reload we can already see it.

31
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:29,010
We get sign up and sign in as soon as it was signed and though we only got the dashboard.

32
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,390
Now that's great.

33
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,810
Now we got a working UI update.

34
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:40,100
Depending on the of state is speaking on the off state we can always reload to log out.

35
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,700
By the way something we'll all to work on later so that we persists the state.

36
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,490
We haven't used dead local storage thing from the sleights at all yet.

37
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,790
But before we move onto debt why don't we add a log out button to.

38
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,330
Wouldn't that be nice.

39
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,510
Let's do this in the next lecture.

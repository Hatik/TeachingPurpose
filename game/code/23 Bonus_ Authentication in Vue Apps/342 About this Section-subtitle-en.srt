00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,810
Well come one important note about this module.

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:12,490
This module is about authentication and to really follow through to US Marshals smoothly.

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:17,980
I strongly recommend going for the X years module first because just like D.

4
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:25,430
X yes bonus module this module was added after the course was released to add some extra content to

5
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,450
the course.

6
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:33,620
It actually used the same project as I use in the X years module and it uses ERYXIAS for reaching out

7
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,450
to the Web.

8
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:39,320
So if you already know this or if you're willing to dig through the code on your own you may skip the

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,490
Access Module.

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:47,270
Otherwise I recommend at least going through the access martial of skipping fluid so of you know what

11
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,820
we're actually working on in this module.

1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,070
Last lecture we finally and code to pass on this token.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:14,250
Now I want to make sure that we can reach the dashboard route if we're not of any kind to do this all

3
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:19,940
at a navigation guard a concept I taught you about in the routeing section.

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,480
We set it up on a per route level.

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:29,070
Well actually you can set up guards on different levels but to prevent the access to a given route the

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,880
per route level makes sense because it checks the guard condition before actually loading the component

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,910
which is of course what we want here.

8
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:47,940
Now here in my router set up I can add D before enter property that actually will be a method and I

9
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,310
will split this up over multiple lines to make it easier to eat.

10
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:59,740
This method will receive free arguments too that will hold information about the router going to from

11
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,080
information where we're coming from.

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:08,590
And next a function I have to execute to continue navigating inside the function.

13
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,040
I now want to check whether we do have a token or not.

14
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:19,450
Because only if we have a token the user is authenticated only then it makes sense to continue to get

15
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:27,490
this information from the store or import to store from dot slash store japes and distort and put it

16
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:27,950
here.

17
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:33,480
It's the same instance as the instance I x' in my components with this dollar signs store.

18
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:42,220
So we're talking about the same store in the four enter I now simply check if stores state so store

19
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:46,540
dot state ID token is set.

20
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,580
If this is true.

21
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,010
So if we have a valid token or execute next.

22
00:01:51,030 --> 00:02:00,940
So the navigation may continue else if the token is false or null if it's invalid I will also call next.

23
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,760
But I'll pass the argument to it which will redirect the request.

24
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,480
If you pass a string Poth you will go to that path.

25
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:15,760
So I want to go to slash sign in this route here.

26
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:23,340
Now if that if I save this and I go back to my application and reloaded to invalidate all tokens I might

27
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,500
have to click on dashboard U.S. see instead I land on sign in.

28
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,740
I can't go to dashboard no matter how hard I try.

29
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:41,070
As soon as I do log in though and I have a token therefore I can access dashboard and this is how easy

30
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:46,160
we can protect a route with before enter and by accessing this store in their.

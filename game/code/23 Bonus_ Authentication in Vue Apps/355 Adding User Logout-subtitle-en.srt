1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,080
In the last lecture we updated our Hetter to only show relevant links.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:14,580
Now I want to add one new link or Option 2 to head for a new list item where we can actually log out

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:15,810
here.

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,700
For that I'll add a button where I say log out.

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,150
We save this.

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,910
Here we get the log out button.

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:32,760
Now let's quickly give to some startling at least so I'll add a class log out here and in my C S code

8
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:42,810
down there for the log out clause all set the background background color to transparent set the border

9
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:55,980
to non set up front to inherit the default font and the color to white and the cursor to pointer with

10
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,870
these tiny changes in place.

11
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,860
It now looks like the Lynx doesn't get the Howard Effect you could at this but I'll simply move on.

12
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,660
And now if I click log out I do want to log out of course.

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,730
So first of all let's register a click listener with ad click and I will execute the on log out method

14
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:22,510
here for data I'll add the methods property to my view instance and add on log out here.

15
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:29,400
Now here I want to dispatch an action which essentially clears my token and user ID.

16
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:37,100
So for that I will add a mutation which I uname clear of data maybe the name is up to you where I received

17
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:47,590
a state and where I simply said state ID token equal to now and where I said state user id equal to

18
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:56,650
null and now with that the other thing I want to do of course is commit disputation from some action

19
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:04,570
so I'll add a new action maybe right willow log in but the position doesn't matter where I get commit

20
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:15,890
extracted from this context object and where I simply commit my new mutation clear of data.

21
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:22,330
So that is what I pass as a string to commit in the log out action and that's all.

22
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:27,550
Now the only thing I have to do in the header component is on my on log out method.

23
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:36,100
I will reach out to my store to dispatch and dispatch log out and now we should be able to go back and

24
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,380
if I now reload

25
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,020
sign in and then click log out.

26
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,510
It actually switches the header you will die.

27
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,020
We can also inspect the state in our view.

28
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,890
Def tools and we see that the state was reset.

29
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:59,580
Now the last thing I'll do is I only want to show the log out button if we are affiliated so I will

30
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,820
add the same check.

31
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,620
As for the dashboard only if we are offending hated this list items should be rendered so that if we

32
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,000
go back to the app by default we don't see it.

33
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,930
As soon as I do log in though we do see that dashboard and log out.

34
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,130
If I click log out here though we stay on the dashboard.

35
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,220
So one additional improvement is to make sure we navigate away.

36
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,220
Well we can also do this in the store in the log out action for this.

37
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:36,230
All I need is access to the router and the router can be imported from this router fall just as a story

38
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,850
could be imported in the router.

39
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:45,960
We can import the router into the store so import router from dot slash router and then we can use that

40
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:54,670
router here in the log out action to not only commit but also call router poorish to navigate away.

41
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:02,490
Or maybe battered and push replace to slash sinad this will actually replace the current route with

42
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,980
that so that he can't go back.

43
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:13,240
Now if that if I try this one more time and sign in and I click on dashboard and then log out.

44
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:20,860
We are back on seinen And with that we get a working log out functionality in the application too.

45
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:27,460
Now one big flaw this app still has is that we can always log out if we reload.

46
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:35,760
Yep and that might not be the desired result because it means that the user loses his session so to

47
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:41,180
say whenever he Leif's our app and comes back shortly after.

48
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:48,940
Additionally our token which we get back from firebase is actually only valid for one hour.

49
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,100
We got no logic to automatically lock the user out after 1 hour right now though.

50
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,790
So these are the next and last two things I want to add to this demo application.

00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:06,890
So after learning about forms and the last module Let's go back to something which we actually have

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:12,260
used to a lot for the course but haven't really put focus on directives.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:19,250
There are these tiny commands starting with the we and then a dash you put on DOM elements like we bind

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,960
or V on that are assembled in directives.

5
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:27,620
And this march we'll have a look at some of the bold indirect of those we already know them all pretty

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:33,050
much but then we mostly will have a look at how we could build our own directive if you need such a

7
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,900
low level access to certain dorm elements.

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,840
Normally I would use a component if you want to but parts of the application and make it reactive.

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,700
Implement your own code but from time to time you only want to place a tiny command on some HDMI element

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,390
to control its behavior.

11
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,900
And that is what we're going to have a look at and this much to.

1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:06,420
Let's Hans's a bit further let's say we not only want to set the background color we want to let the

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,870
user decide if you want to set the background or the default the text color.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,040
So the user has to explicitly state that you want to change the background color otherwise only the

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,800
text color will be changed to do this.

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,480
We need to pass an argument.

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,980
So I'm thinking about the following syntax.

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,050
We get a value of that but an argument passed with a colon.

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,650
That is how all views directives work.

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,170
The BIND would be one example.

10
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,600
There we have to shorten with just call it that won't work here because we need to specify a name of

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,570
course.

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,900
Colon we pass an argument and the argument could be background like that.

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,390
Now that's no string that's a normal text in our template here.

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,160
This is something which will be treated as an argument that in our directive.

15
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:59,880
So in our maintenance file in this directive I will comment on this code again because now I want to

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:05,440
check if my argument on the binding I can access this with Arek.

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,760
If this is now background now here it has to be treated as a string because data as to what this will

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,650
be can work behind the scenes.

19
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,960
So our IT ISN'T number thing we can access on our binding.

20
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,430
We already saw value to get the part between the quotation marks.

21
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,030
Now with Arek we can get the info after a colon.

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,370
So it's Baghran in this case.

23
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:31,400
And here I want to check Well if the binding argument is background then I want to set the elements

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:41,370
style background color to the binding value and otherwise I want to set the elements style color so

25
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,580
the text color to binding got value.

26
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:51,890
Now if I save this we still see the red background because indeed I do pass the background color here

27
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,070
the background art.

28
00:01:53,370 --> 00:02:02,500
But if I were to remove this art this argument we see that now the text color is red.

29
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,290
So this is how we can switch between that.

30
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:13,780
No argument means we're ending up in this block with an argument background will end up in the background

31
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,400
color case you need to refresh this because the hods reloading is not handling this correctly but it

32
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,640
does work as it should.

33
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,910
We're in our running code.

34
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,260
This is how we can use arguments and values.

35
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,870
Now let's also have a look at how we can add our own modifiers.

36
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,500
The first two will we happen working with directives.

37
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,180
Remember that we got arguments the value and modifiers.

38
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,800
So let's have a look at the last two words in the next video.

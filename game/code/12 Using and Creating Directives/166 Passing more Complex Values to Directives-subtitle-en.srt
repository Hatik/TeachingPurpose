1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,270
We get our blinking directive.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:09,100
That's nice but it would also be nice if we could control both colors not just the main color and the

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,320
entire wall over which it should belong.

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:15,190
So how long each color should remain there to do this.

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:20,160
I simply need to pass in a more complex thing than just a string here.

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,010
I can pass in an object as a value.

7
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:33,160
Now here I could set up the main color to be red and the second color to be let's say green and then

8
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:39,130
and that key could be the delay which shall be let's say five hundred to make it blink faster.

9
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,520
Now with that being an object I need to adjust my code here.

10
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:48,450
Here say X is binding color here for example where it treat the main color.

11
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:55,330
I want to excess binding and now value but then main color.

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,760
I know I do have access to this because I pass it here.

13
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,610
Of course you could introduce a check to make sure that this really is passed here I know I do always

14
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,620
pass it so I will take the shortcut.

15
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,390
Let's do the same here for the second color like this.

16
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,510
I can do this because value simply is an object and passing in chest doesn't care what type.

17
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:22,030
This argument or I shouldn't say argument this value of the directive has could be a string as before

18
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:26,000
it can be object like here and then we can use it like object.

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:32,710
Now that also means that I can set up the interval here by accessing binding value delay and of course

20
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,110
I also need to adjuster's down here where I also use my binding value here.

21
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,570
I want to use the binding value but then X is main color here.

22
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,760
I'm not alternating so main color or color as all in need of this in place let's see this in action.

23
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:52,660
And we do see it change faster between green and red which are the two colors we set up here.

24
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:59,260
And that is how we can write our own directive registred locally and make it more powerful with multiple

25
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:05,070
modifiers with a more complex data being passed there as a value and our own argument.

26
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,740
This is what I wanted to show you.

27
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,260
And with that you should be prepared to write your own practice.

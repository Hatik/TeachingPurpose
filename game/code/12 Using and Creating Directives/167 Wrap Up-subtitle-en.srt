1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:06,580
In this module we had a look at directives both built in ones and custom ones.

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:12,440
We learned that it is key to have the v dash at the beginning and then the name of the director follows.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:18,650
You also learn how to create global and local directives how to pass arguments and modifiers and how

4
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:24,890
to pass a value both a simple value like a string or a more complex value like an object like we do

5
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,620
here in the second directive from the local one.

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,510
With that you should be prepared to create your own directive and play around with the different hooks

7
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:37,430
and the different things you can Pasztor you can do with the element and said so on and so on.

8
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,010
And with that let's continue to observe features namely FOTR s next.

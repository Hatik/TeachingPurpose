1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,320
Registering a local director is easy.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,110
So here in my laptop you file where I have this instance I can register a local directive and I can

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,000
do that in every component by adding the directives property.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:21,240
You know we already have components like this to register local components while it works the same forward

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,860
directives here.

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,330
I'd then have the name of that directive.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,150
And this can be a string like local highlight for example or of course the camel case the worse off

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,050
that again you will attach this by adding the minus this name.

9
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,930
Now here this is again an object.

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:45,490
So just like on the global directivity second argument is this the value we passed to the school year.

11
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,840
And there we will again have bind does this D major book we use to set up what our directive should

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,160
do typically.

13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,910
Here again I get my data on my binding my v note and the element and then a when I basically set it

14
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,750
up as my global directive.

15
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,170
But add more features to it.

16
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,630
So first of all I will copy the code of my global directive here with the said time out and so on with

17
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,160
that modifier.

18
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,700
All these things.

19
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:20,080
So I will add another paragraph and here I want to use the local highlight that of course is when you

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,240
name I chose down there and the minors at the beginning is always needed.

21
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,430
Now safe.

22
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,410
We see that both should get read after three seconds.

23
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:29,610
Looks good.

24
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,380
Now that is how a widget or a local directive.

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,180
Now let's work on it to add some extra features.

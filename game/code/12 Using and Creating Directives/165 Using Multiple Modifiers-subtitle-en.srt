1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,210
Which features could I add to my directive.

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:10,940
Well I want to show how to use multiple modifiers and how to pass more complex data than just a string

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:11,550
here.

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,890
Let's start with the model model for us.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:21,590
Let's say a one at a modifier word is not only has the possibility you get added delayed but also to

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,300
blink.

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:31,260
So to alternate between two states one sigh Well have it set it up so I can add Don't blink here.

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,200
Now in order to be able to use this I also need to check this of course in my code.

9
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:45,930
So hirable add another if check where I check if binding modifiers has this Blinkx key here.

10
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:53,040
Now if I do have this I want to set up this time out and then the interval inside of this time out.

11
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,490
Otherwise in the else block if we don't have this modifier I just want to use the timeout as with that

12
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,030
before.

13
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,850
So this code will remain untouched.

14
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:10,740
Now what I want to do here in the blink case well here I simply want to alternate between two colors.

15
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,410
So I will create new variables and I use the VAR before.

16
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:22,210
But since views 6 code I can also use LET here let ISDE ESX variable which is block skilled.

17
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:26,580
That is a difference and you want to check out that 6 tutorial to learn more about it.

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,450
You could still use Wardo.

19
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:36,060
So let here just to alternate This allows me to define a new variable and I will set up the main color

20
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:36,700
here.

21
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,940
The main color shall be green.

22
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,700
Let's say then I will set up my second color and this shall be blue.

23
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:50,390
Because again when I blink I want to switch between both colors.

24
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,010
I can also say the main colors should be what the user passes.

25
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,380
So let's say binding value.

26
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,850
I still do pass a color here red.

27
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,720
So let's use that.

28
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,440
Why not.

29
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,850
So now I get two colors.

30
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,930
The second color is hardcoded the first color is set the settable by the user the main color that is.

31
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:14,110
I also want to have a current color and at the beginning this shall be my main color here like dat.

32
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,720
OK so with that that's now.

33
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,290
Copy that says time out code.

34
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:26,500
But inside there to make it blink I also need to set an interval soil execute set interval interval

35
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,750
like this.

36
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:34,870
And there let's set up the duration it should take or how long it should take for it to keep one state

37
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,550
before it alternates again.

38
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,650
Let's set this to one second so that we can clearly see this is of course totally up to you.

39
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,530
And you could also make the cell from outside I will soon show you how.

40
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,510
So here is set interval.

41
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,410
Then takes a callback which is executed every one second.

42
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,730
But it only starts after these three seconds though because it is nested inside the set.

43
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:02,660
Time out and here I want to check if the current color equals the second color.

44
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,870
If that is the case then the current color is the main color because it obviously is the second color

45
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,260
right now.

46
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,950
So I wanted to switch it otherwise I want to do the opposite then current color.

47
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,760
Shelby the second color.

48
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,110
So that basically will switch my colors.

49
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,750
That's all I'm doing here.

50
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,310
And that of course shall not be if statement.

51
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,310
That's a normal ordinary statement.

52
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,850
So like this.

53
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,220
This will change my colors.

54
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:33,890
The next line then decides whether it shall change the background color or not.

55
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:39,400
So I will take this code which is currently outside of the interval and put it inside of the interval.

56
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,880
So this is of course needed because you still are able to set back on as argument here as we do.

57
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,040
So that will determine what color should be alternated.

58
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:54,130
Now of course they all need to change this the background color should now be set to the current color

59
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,480
as should be the color in case we're not passing the background argument with this someplace.

60
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,010
Let's see if that works.

61
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,200
It should start up there free seconds and it alternates.

62
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,320
It took an initial of one second because we set up the interval to be 1 second.

63
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,980
But as you can see it now blinks.

64
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,700
Awesome.

65
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,430
This is where you want it.

66
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:22,060
Now let's see how we can control both colors and not just one as well as the duration of this blinking

67
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,370
intro.

68
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,600
Well I'll show you how to do all these things in the next video.

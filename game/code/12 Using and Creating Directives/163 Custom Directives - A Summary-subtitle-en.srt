1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,480
That is first direct to people out here.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,280
It's very nice.

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,160
It shows us how to use arguments modifiers and the value.

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,700
It shows us how to use all that together to build our own global directive.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:18,370
And the next thing I want to show you how to create a local directive which is only usable in one instance

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:25,000
and one component and also how to create a even more powerful or feature rich directive.

00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,600
So let's work on that next.

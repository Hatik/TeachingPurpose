1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,130
Well I'm back in my editor and this is a brand new project.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,560
The only thing I did again is I ordered bootstrap year to get some basic styling and I set up some columns

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:10,790
here.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,980
But besides that that's all it did.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:21,300
And there at first when I look at some built in directives of UJA ships with now we already know a lot

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:29,570
of them like the earth the for the blind directives are generally always identified like this.

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,160
You have to be at the beginning and the miners and then the name of the directive.

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,230
So divi mines part is not part of the directive name.

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,100
That just tells Mujeres that this is not a normal attribute in normal HVM l attribute it should ignore.

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,010
But instead the this is a directive it should handle.

11
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,540
So the name follows after the dash and then we could have some for example the text correct.

12
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:57,480
That's a in one text directive takes a string as a put Therefore the single quotation marks between

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,130
the outer quotation marks which only marked the javascript expression Kanno entered there.

14
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,320
And here it could add some text.

15
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,040
So now after saving this we should see some text here.

16
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,910
Even though I didn't enter anything between the opening and closing paragraph tag just by using the

17
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:22,360
text I can also duplicators to use the H M L to put some H I'll kill.

18
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,600
That's also a string.

19
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:32,130
But now we could use these strong tag and close it of course and then we could put some strong text.

20
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,200
Now if I say this and go to my app you'll see it's bold.

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,570
Be careful when using this directive you should sanitize your output to make sure you're not getting

22
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:46,420
a victim of cross-site scripting attacks because you can output H.T. molecules there.

23
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,200
And that of course could all be malicious script tags.

24
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,360
So that's something to watch out for.

25
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,700
These are bold interactive.

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,650
Important thing.

27
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:59,290
You identify them by having the B minus at the beginning not just build in ones directives in general

28
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,510
knowledge both our own directives.

29
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,470
So here I will simply add a horizontal line then copy this whole row.

30
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,800
Because now here I want to set out set up some custom directives all use.

31
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,640
Now I'll be able to build a simple custom directive which shows how to generally use them and which

32
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,460
feature such a directive has let's say I have a paragraph with some text where I say color does.

33
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:28,750
And my goal was to add a directive which gives states some coloring so some background color for example

34
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,910
of course I could use a symbol style for days like background color and then set the color.

35
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:39,310
But here I want to show how a directive works and coloring it highlighting it is actually a great use

36
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,620
case because it shows many of the features that elective office us or we can implement a custom directive

37
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,480
I should say.

38
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,900
So how do we create such a directive.

39
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,250
Well we get two options of doing so.

40
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:57,730
The first one is to register it globally just like with components we can use the you and then the directive

41
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:03,990
like this here the first argument is de-select or the name of the directive.

42
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,170
And that is without the B minus thing.

43
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:14,600
So here we could have highlight this will create a global directive called highlight which you don't

44
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,600
use by adding V minors highlight to an element.

45
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,410
So the minuses always need to inform veejay as to this is a directive.

46
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:28,790
The name then Justice Depart without the B minus and then the second argument is do you object configuring

47
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,920
the directive.

48
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,180
Now how do we configure such a directive.

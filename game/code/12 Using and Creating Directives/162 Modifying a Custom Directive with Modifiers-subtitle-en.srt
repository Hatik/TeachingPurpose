An author adding our own value here between the quotation marks and our own argument after the colon

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,740
I also want to add a modifier.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,160
Now how do you do that.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,030
Let's first think about what this modifier could do here.

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,320
Let's say you want to change the style delayed.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,450
So we want to wait let's say three seconds before changing the style.

7
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,940
We only want to do that though if I add the delayed modifier.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,500
So Dot delayed of course that doesn't exist yet.

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,950
But now we can create such a modifier to handle this case.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,500
So in the main js file I therefore want to check if we get these modifiers set up.

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,660
I will therefore set a variable of delay which is zero by default.

12
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:53,100
So to have no delay and then I want to check if our binding has modifiers.

13
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,550
No modifiers is an array and there I want to check.

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,570
Or an object.

15
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,550
I should say excuse me and then I want to check if we have the delayed key here.

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,700
So I'm checking if Diski key exists and the modifiers array if that is something we do have.

17
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:14,950
And if we do have delayed edit then I want to set a delay to 0 0 0 two or three seconds.

18
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:22,060
That allows me to now add a set timeout function where I will wait for the delay duration which is 0

19
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,550
initially but can be 3000 if we add them all that fire.

20
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:32,800
And in the callback function here well there I simply want to execute this code I had outside of the

21
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,390
callback or outside of the time one function before.

22
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:41,200
Now with that we see if I reload this it takes a couple of seconds before the styling is applied.

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Because we do have to delight modifier added.

24
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:51,080
Now of course if I remove the delayed modifier here and safe to say again you're now see it is simply

25
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:59,050
a threat because now again we don't have a delay only if I add delayed here do we get this an important

26
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,730
modifier.

27
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:05,980
Here is an object because of course you can add multiple modifiers by changing multiple model for us

28
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,650
like this.

29
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,430
So a number modifier by DOT and number.

30
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:16,000
But here we only have one and I can use it by simply accessing it here as a property which will only

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,320
give me true if it is set and that is why I can use my own modifier here on my own directive.

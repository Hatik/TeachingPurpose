1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:07,740
And now we get this basic directive which simply changes the background color to Green now would be

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,630
nice to let the user determine the background color.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,520
Therefore as a new step I'm going to comment out the old code here.

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,430
I will still set the style of this element.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:24,050
I will set still set the background color but I want to set it to binding that value.

6
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,450
Now binding is the information about our directive binding.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,290
So about this code here.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:36,140
And value is whatever we enter between quotation marks when passing it with the equal sign.

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,850
So here Desch shall be a string sains.

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,920
Well we need to set it up as a string.

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,560
And here we could set this to read and want to do this and save this we already see that it now has

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,640
a red background.

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,520
Because again whatever we enter here between the quotation marks is the value of the binding and we

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,040
do use the value binding here.

15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,580
When I set the background color so that quickly improved our directive by now making it much more flexible

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,140
because now we are able to set the value from outside.

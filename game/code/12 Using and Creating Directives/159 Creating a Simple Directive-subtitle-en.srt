1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:06,390
So I'm back to my own directive and we just learned that we get these hooks to work with it.

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,590
So let's implement rebind to here like a method.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:16,510
This is like a lifecycle method in a component but here is a directive so blind as we learned gives

4
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,680
us access to the element to the binding and the virtual node.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,110
Now we won't need all the arguments here or just wanted to list them and then let's say what I want

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:32,440
to do here is I want to simply set the style of my element the element here of course is the native

7
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:37,870
HTML elements I have access to the style properties that are normal Chalis good property of a built

8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:45,670
in HDMI element and there are want to set the background color to let's say green to start simple.

9
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,590
We will soon update this to be more powerful.

10
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:56,920
Well with that set up I can go to my app view file and since it is a global directive with you highlight

11
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,480
selector here I can simply add v highlight like this.

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,360
No argument passed no value passed nothing at all just like this.

13
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,330
Now if I save this you'll see it indeed has the green background.

14
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,600
So our directive is already working.

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,540
Now of course it would be nice if we could manually control which color to should get.

16
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,870
So we'll work on this next.

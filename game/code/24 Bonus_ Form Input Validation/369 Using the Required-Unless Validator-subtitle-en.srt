1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:09,000
Now we all really learn a lot about some built in Belyaev years before we move towards this array here

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,100
where we can add multiple hobbies which of course is interesting when it comes to a validation perspective.

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,410
Let's move to this check box and let's do two things.

4
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:29,670
I want to make sure that it is required but only if let's say the country is not any country of your

5
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:36,180
choice so let's say if it's not Germany just picking a random country because Will I'm going from there

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,150
let's say if it is Germany then you don't have to tick that box because for some complex legal reasons

7
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:48,720
which we have in Germany we are not allowed to force you to accept the terms something like that.

8
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:58,340
So we essentially have a required if condition or to be very precise are required unless condition you're

9
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,930
required to check this unless you picked Germany in a totally different input.

10
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:12,330
Now I think that's also an interesting case and it's surprisingly easy to implement.

11
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,590
So how can we implement that.

12
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,910
Let's first start with a general required you'll forward a checkbox.

13
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:27,120
All named is turd's this rule and ultimately simply required the required validate or the normal one.

14
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:34,560
Now with that set up I can go up to my template and dare on days checkbox input going to distributor's

15
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,660
over multiple lines.

16
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:42,290
I want to listen for the change event which is fired whenever we click this and put this checkbox.

17
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,800
And I then want to trigger Dolor Send be turd's was the name of the validation group dollar assigned

18
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,590
touched.

19
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,610
Ask Before touch not touched.

20
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,560
So it is just a method I want to execute now to see if something changes I'll add my old class to does

21
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,750
my class binding to this wrapping div.

22
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:07,260
Well at the invalid class if bowlers send b terms has donors sign error.

23
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,510
With that let's go back and let's see if Dad works.

24
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:17,280
Right now it's not marked as invalid because we have set this up to only be marked as invalid if we

25
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,330
have an error and an error is only fired once we had a chance to click.

26
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,400
But if I do click here and I uncheck this it's marked as invalid.

27
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:33,280
Although the side node for this specific case it might be more helpful to not check for a dollar or

28
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:39,120
an error but Dollar Sign invalid to mark it as a Mellot right from the start.

29
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,180
When we load this page so that it's obvious we need to check this.

30
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,440
So this is rooking But this is the normal required validator.

31
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,490
Now we want to use this other one.

32
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,450
First of all let's import it required unless it's to name.

33
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,330
And this allows us to connect as with some other value.

34
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:05,970
So now all still named is required but all assigned required unless as a value and just as same as this

35
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,020
is a function.

36
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:15,900
Now for this function ask before we receive access to the new instance and now here we can return true

37
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,890
or false.

38
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:24,420
If a return true here we go back you'll see it that's not always treated as correct no matter what I

39
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,350
do for return false is always treated as invalid.

40
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,100
Therefore to go back you see it's always red.

41
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,060
Gore's hard coding true or false doesn't make much sense.

42
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:41,190
But we can now check if we em and now we have to check the name of this dropdown.

43
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,930
So Dad was country were binding to a property named country.

44
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:55,530
We want a check of country is essentially not equal to Germany because that is the value we have for

45
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,600
this option which is treated as invalid.

46
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,470
As I said.

47
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:08,490
So we simply check if we m country is the property name if it is equal to Germany what this means is

48
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:15,640
that if countries Germany debt is required because here we have required unless So unless the country

49
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,510
is Germany it is required.

50
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:23,130
So they're required validator to normal required validator will be attached if the country was selected

51
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,280
as not Germany.

52
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,240
So if that if we go back and reload this page you'll see it's still red at the beginning.

53
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,380
Check it it's fine though because it works as a normal required validator.

54
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:40,920
Now if we switch to a country to Germany though you'll see it becomes black in all cases because now

55
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,510
it's not required anymore.

56
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,530
So this is required if not for a nice validator which all this shows you.

57
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,010
Another powerful feature of Yulee date.

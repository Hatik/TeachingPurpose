1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:09,650
In the last lecture we edit some code to change the styling of the input then the user did enter something

2
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,270
invalid.

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:16,850
And maybe you wondered whether you could control when this is marked as invalid because right now it

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,800
isn't at the start which is good.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,120
But if I type one character it's marked as invalid.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,090
Now you could argue that this also doesn't provide such a good user experience because it means that

7
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,150
we already show error message.

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:36,740
Once the user starts typing even before he had a chance to enter a valid email address which simply

9
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,150
isn't done by typing one character.

10
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,330
Now of course you can control when this is evaluated.

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,760
We did use the at it put event here to fire this dollar sign that she meant we don't have to use an

12
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,610
input here.

13
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:56,900
We could use at blur disna would only fire once the input loses focus.

14
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:02,460
So now we go back and reload the supplication for type 1 character.

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,800
It's still not read only if I click out of there it's marked as read.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,610
So this might be the user experience you maybe want to provide.

17
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,070
Now you can keep on typing as long as you want.

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,920
Only if you leave this form with an invalid value.

19
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,150
Your showing does error message and your error or styles.

20
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:27,000
So this is an alternative which I wanted to show you and it's not just blur.

21
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,770
It all comes down to when you call dollar sign.

22
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,920
Touch you can call this whenever you want.

23
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,740
You could add a button which is not connected to the input which calls dollar sign touch for this email

24
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,540
property on dollar B.

25
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:49,430
You can call dollar sign touch whenever you feel that now is the right time to evaluate does input and

26
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,040
that again is totally up to you.

27
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,910
This is one of the cool features of the Bewley date package.

28
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,690
You've got a lot of control over it.

29
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,530
You don't have to use the approach as shown here.

30
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:05,330
You can find you just your needs to really validate and potentially show errors.

31
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,190
At the point of time you do want to do that.

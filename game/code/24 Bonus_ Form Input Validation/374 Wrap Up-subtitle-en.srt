1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:08,810
So with the addition of asynchronous validation and The Last Lecture we added a number extremely useful

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,280
tool to our toolset.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:19,460
Now we can really handle for validation with ease and we can make sure that we always submit forms which

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:28,810
are valid and which therefore pass data onto our back end or whatever we're doing with it that we need.

5
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,930
I hope you saw the many features Vueling date offers.

6
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,020
Now one important note Bula date is only one option.

7
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:44,210
There are Obert validation packages like the validate links can be found in the last lecture of this

8
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,450
module.

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,040
Date is a very powerful and still simple to use package though.

10
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,470
So I can only recommend using it.

11
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,790
And with that feel free to play around with that.

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,420
Add it to your next View project dive into the Vully date documentation which I showed you at build

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,250
awesome forums that only are valid.

14
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,280
If you want it.

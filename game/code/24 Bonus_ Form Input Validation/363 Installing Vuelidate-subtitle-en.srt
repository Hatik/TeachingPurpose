1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,150
So I'm back in the project.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:12,070
I also use in the X years and authentication module it's dissipates here where we can sign up sign in

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,890
and then also fetch some data from the server.

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,520
Now in this video I want to focus on this.

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:24,010
Sign up for him because it deliberately contains a lot of different inputs and I want to show you how

6
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:31,000
we can validate this for and this includes things like checking if for example we have a valid email

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,550
address if the passwords match.

8
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,040
And also things like if the e-mail address is already taken.

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,680
So let's dive into that.

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:47,080
As I mentioned we're going to use a third party package for this because the framework itself doesn't

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,510
have input validation built into it like angular has for example.

12
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:57,640
But there are great alternatives out there which you can pick and the alternative I want to present

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,070
is Yula date Bula date is effort a package developed by a monorail and you can check out its get up

14
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:11,350
page or does documentation page on montral dot get up dot Io's slash you will a date where you can

15
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,490
learn more about it.

16
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:18,280
And I strongly recommend diving into this page if you want to unlock all the functionalities of that

17
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,520
package and really want to use all its features.

18
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,950
I'm going to walk you through the majority of them in this module though.

19
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:32,320
So this is the package I want to use and we already see that we can install it via NPM So that is what

20
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,250
I'll do in this lecture before then in the next lectures we start using it.

21
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:43,630
So let's head back to our project and let's quit the NPM run death process and let's now simply run

22
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,640
NPM and STOL dash dash save.

23
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,280
And then it's Vueling date.

24
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:54,460
One word once you typed this you can hit enter to install it in this project and once it is finished

25
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,610
we're ready to go to take advantage of the features.

26
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:02,130
This package exposes let's dive into them in the next lecture.

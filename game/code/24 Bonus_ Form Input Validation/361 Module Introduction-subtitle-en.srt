00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:09,330
Well come to this module as announced in the previous video does Marchal builds up on the authentication

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,310
and Access Module in a way that we use the same project.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,140
You can still dive into this march without going through these first.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,290
But then of course some things like usage of access might be new to you in this module however.

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,180
Focus on validating user input.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,980
In his view course we already have a whole section where we talk about forums how we can create custom

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,510
controls all these things.

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,090
That's all nice.

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:42,900
But one thing we haven't really touched on is how you can validate what the user enters if it is correct

10
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,870
F-8 fulfills your requirements in this module.

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,850
I'll show you a third party package which offers such validation functionality because the view itself

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,910
doesn't have it built into it.

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,490
So with that let's start and let's see how we can find out if our users entered the data.

14
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,700
We expect to get.

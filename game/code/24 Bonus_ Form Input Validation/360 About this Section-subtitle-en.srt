00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,410
Welcome to this module.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,880
Great to have you here in this module.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,250
We'll have a look at validation input validation.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:17,930
This module takes the same project and uses the same project as we used in the X years and authentication

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:18,850
module.

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,130
You don't necessarily need to complete these modules.

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,370
Just be aware that it basically builds up on them.

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:31,340
It used the same project and therefore if there are some features in that module which you don't understand

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:36,960
features in the project code you find attached to this module then you might get back to the bone as

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:42,770
modules about X years and off indication to learn how this was build up from the ground.

11
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,470
You can still dive into this module without watching them if you only want to see the validation part.

12
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:54,070
Just make sure that you dig through the source code to understand what the project does with that.

13
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,770
Let's start.

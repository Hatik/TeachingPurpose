00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,990
Over the last lectures we learn a lot about control validation.

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:13,760
Now it's always nice to show validation errors next to the controls but maybe we all want to disable

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:21,440
the form submit button if we get any validation errors in our form.

4
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:34,580
No the hard way of doing that would be to bind disabled here to Dolor V email air and so on to disable

5
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,150
it.

6
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,800
If not and but.

7
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,410
Or to disable this.

8
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:47,720
If any of our control groups has an error the Quaker way conveniently is to just excess bowler V error

9
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:56,630
because that simply means if any of our validations here fails then this error is set to True and this

10
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:02,620
will be disabled and maybe we even want to set it to invalid to disable it right from the start.

11
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,890
And not only after the user started typing we now save this and we go back.

12
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,590
We see that right at the start the button is disabled and I can't click it.

13
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,030
We can also confirmed is that the console can click if nothing happens.

14
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:22,170
I have to enter Veldts data into all of these fields.

15
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,950
So let me quickly do that.

16
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,780
Except an ad hobby's

17
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,340
and only after I did this.

18
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,790
I can click Submit now.

19
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:42,910
This simply fails because I submitted an email address which is already taken on the back and we don't

20
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,060
have to care about this year.

21
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:50,050
The validation worked and this obviously is what this mortal is about though.

22
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,420
Does email address already taken.

23
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,300
Thing is interesting.

24
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,640
Wouldn't it be great if we warned the user right during validating his email address.

25
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,830
Weber does is a valid email address or not or if it is already taken.

26
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:10,090
Well let's dive into debt and therefore into asynchronous validators in the next lecture.

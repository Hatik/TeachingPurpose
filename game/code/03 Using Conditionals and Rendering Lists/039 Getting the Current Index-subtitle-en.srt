1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:07,410
What if you not only wanted to display the string but also the position so the index of the item.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,260
So let's say you wanted to say ingredient and then in parentheses that has no syntax.

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:17,050
By the way that's just normal text here then here you want it to display the index.

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:21,030
So with double curly braces I want to get X this too.

5
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,410
Well the index let's name it I.

6
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:30,710
Well I it's not defined it never has a property in my view instance down here nor is it available for

7
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,060
this loop here.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,890
We can make it available.

9
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:40,430
We were able to specify ingredient here as a name for word VERY to curb the value of our loop iteration

10
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,210
has.

11
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,760
We can also alter the syntax.

12
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:50,840
I can set up parentheses here and now not only extract the ingredient so the current item but also the

13
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,840
index of the item by simply adding it here with a comma.

14
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,540
Let's name it.

15
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,020
I because I use I over there.

16
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,180
Let me make this a bit broader so that we can easier read it.

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,080
So I your refers to this I an ingredient to this.

18
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:09,150
So with that we're setting our own names it is totally up to you.

19
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:14,840
These two names here whereas setting these names and we're extracting first and the order is important

20
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,970
first dickered element and second the index off that element.

21
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:27,060
If we now had control enter you see our ingredients followed by the index of this ingredient again.

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,730
Just going to emphasize is the order is important here.

23
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:36,290
The first element in the parentheses is always the element the value of the element and the 0 8 and

24
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,850
the second element.

25
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,660
In this case is always the index of this element in this array.

26
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,320
This is how easy a looping or dynamically outputting can that with a LWB is NUJ as.

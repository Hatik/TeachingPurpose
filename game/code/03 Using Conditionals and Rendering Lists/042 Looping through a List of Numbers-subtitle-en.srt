1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:07,150
What if you only want to output a list of numbers let's say you want to output the numbers 1 to 10 that

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,080
is very easy to do.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:18,070
You can output these numbers with a span let's say with before and then an in ten and again is up to

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:18,650
you.

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:23,550
But 10 of course clearly does not refer to a property in my view chess instance.

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:31,300
Instead if you specify a number here you chaps will simply lube frood the whole range of integers starting

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,020
at 1 and going all the way up to his final number here.

8
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:41,830
So then I could output any here again and is a name of your choice and you see one two three four five

9
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:47,200
six seven eight nine 10 over there on the right as we loop through this range of numbers.

10
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,930
It's a very short and quick and convenient syntax if you know that all you want to do is loop through

11
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,020
these numbers from 1 to 10.

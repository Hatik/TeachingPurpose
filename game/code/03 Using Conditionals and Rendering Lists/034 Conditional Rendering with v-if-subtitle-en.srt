1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:08,840
I'm back in a brand new Js fellow project very simple task can see just my view instance which is show

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,210
property in a data field and then two paragraphs in my day of the year.

3
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,740
So if we run this you can see me.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:23,750
And do you also see me now ask these techs already imply we're now going to work with conditionally

5
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,390
showing and hiding or attaching and detaching aliments to the dawn.

6
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,970
That's a task you'll probably see in all the applications you've built.

7
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,740
You don't want to show everything on your template all the time.

8
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,930
Sometimes you only want to show an error message.

9
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,690
Let's say in case of a wrong input in a form input or something like that.

10
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:50,350
So you want it conditionally shows certain messages or elements on your page.

11
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,970
Now you chaps of course include some efforts to allow you to easily do that.

12
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,100
So let's dive into them and have a look at them.

13
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:06,740
And I'm going to start with Vi if that's a directive we can add to a paragraph or two any element B

14
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,520
if just like that.

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,940
And it allows us to bind it to a condition or to a property whatever which resolves to True or false

16
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,030
in the end is the important thing.

17
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,070
So it could find it to show here too.

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:29,930
Well Chaudiere since this is set to Drew if I now add a button where I'd say switch or whatever you

19
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,650
like and then add a click listener where I said show it you.

20
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,140
Well the opposite of show.

21
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,050
So basically switch it.

22
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:46,400
If I now save this you can see that once I hit this button you see the you can see text disappear and

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,230
now it's back there.

24
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,400
Important thing if we inspect this.

25
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,710
This is the paragraph element.

26
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:58,000
If I now switch you see it disappeared entirely.

27
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:04,550
We only get this comment left which kind of shows us that something was there but it is gone.

28
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,720
It's not hidden it's not transparent.

29
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:14,940
It's gone and thus is important to understand the if really attaches or detaches elements to the dorm.

30
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:21,950
It not just Height's them it completely removes them if you will have a false condition here or if the

31
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,330
condition returns false.

32
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,710
Here we can also be extended.

33
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,150
I'll add a new paragraph.

34
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:37,850
Now you see me and I'll add the else the else will automatically refer to the latest we if in front

35
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,300
of it.

36
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:46,370
So this one here and if we compile these you see that we switch now between now you see me and you can

37
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:46,940
see me.

38
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:53,240
So I showed the else condition whenever the if condition is false which makes sense like a normal if

39
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,500
else statement.

40
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,770
Notice you don't have the Altes if and so on.

41
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:03,110
You would simply need to create a new statement if you want to check multiple conditions.

42
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,520
This is just a shortcut.

43
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:10,010
If you know you get it either or decision then the infant Veals allows you to quickly get started and

44
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,210
set this up.

45
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:16,340
Also notice the if shows the entire element and all nested elements.

46
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:21,640
So if I nest the element inside this paragraph for example does span well.

47
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,520
This is also a fact that Biot.

48
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:29,600
So it really removes the complete aliment and all nested elements not just the element leaving behind

49
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,400
the nested ones.

50
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,880
No that's not how it works.

51
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,630
Everything gets removed or attached whatever the condition says.

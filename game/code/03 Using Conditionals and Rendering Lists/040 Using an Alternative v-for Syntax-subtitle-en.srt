1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,460
Similar only to d the f directive.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:12,270
Why have you not want to output a list item here but you wanted to output a heading where you output

3
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:21,290
the ingredient name let's say followed by a paragraph where you output the index Well you could loop

4
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,810
by using a template for that just as before.

5
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:32,360
The template tag won't get rendered but if we replace the for on that template just like that just like

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:39,310
before and B if then it will render everything inside of this template just like it renders it up here

7
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,230
where we place it directly on the item.

8
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,690
So here I could basically copy this loop here.

9
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:57,810
Rename this to index though since I use index down here and if I now had control enter you see meat

10
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,210
0 fruit 1 cookies 2.

11
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:07,650
So this is another way of using the form with a template to use multiple of non nested elements with

12
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,420
this loop.

1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:12,740
Speaking of show and hide viewed as indeed also has an option to be if we if As mentioned before completely

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,510
at Hatcher's or detaches element 2 to dawn.

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,160
So it removes it or it adds it it doesn't hide it.

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,980
Well if you want to hide it might be that you do want to hide it.

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,180
You can do this by using V show instead.

6
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,880
It has the same syntax as we have besides the name.

7
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,810
So we show instead of we have.

8
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:42,410
Works fine but it allows us to now switch does remove it.

9
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:49,220
And now if we inspect this do you also see the text which has the show attached which does element here

10
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,100
on the right.

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,240
Here Do y'all see me if I switch.

12
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,810
It's still there.

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,060
But it got this new style display nonne.

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,540
That's the key difference.

15
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,770
It's not detached.

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,290
It's still there it's just not displayed anymore.

17
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,810
Bruce C S S This might also be the behavior we want.

18
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,640
Maybe you don't want to detach the element.

19
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,200
Maybe for some reason you want to keep it around in your dorm.

20
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,660
And then this would be the way to do it.

21
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:25,350
If you are sure you don't want to detach it use the show to only hide it and not remove it entirely

22
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,510
from the dawn.

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:33,090
The D4 though will be to use the if as it is also better performance wise to have less elements in the

24
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:33,710
dorm.

25
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,620
It makes sense removing not required elements but if you have the special case that you absolutely needed

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,860
use of the show.

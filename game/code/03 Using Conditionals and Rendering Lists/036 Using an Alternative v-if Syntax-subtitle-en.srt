1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,510
You also get the alternative of setting up a template.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,280
You want to attach or remove so I could use template here.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:16,510
This is HVM L5 code and the template tag doesn't get rendered in the dawn.

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,640
You won't see a template there.

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:25,530
So if by now at the inside a template paragraph here and rendered as you see inside a template.

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:31,110
But if we inspect that you don't see a wrapping template element over there.

7
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,200
Do you see that.

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,630
So this is how a template works.

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:42,280
This allows us to attach the IV Tudor's template here to now also toggle days.

10
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,840
And now you ask what's the difference to you first version.

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,320
Well we can wrap multiple elements in here like a heading for example.

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,680
Notice that they are not nested in each other.

13
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,930
And since we can only attach we if to one element while we can attach to multiple ones.

14
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:07,770
But we can't say we if on this element and also have it affect the next one which is not nested inside.

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,640
I can simply wrap it in a template which won't be visible in the end but to group all the elements which

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,670
I want you grouped together with that we have.

17
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,110
The alternative would of course be a div but maybe you don't want a day if you don't want to have the

18
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:29,990
side effects of introduces then template we have would be a valid option to droop multiple elements.

19
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,480
You want to show or hide or ADD or detach to be precise to Gebre.

1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,770
That I am in a brand new Fedele.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:11,630
Once again this time very lean but I already populated my data with some ingredients which is an array

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:17,180
with some strings and some persons also an array but with objects.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,080
Why do I do this.

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:25,460
Well since I have arrays here it looks like we're now getting into lists outputting lists.

6
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,580
Imagine you want to output this list of ingredients.

7
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:34,610
So we want to create an order list with a list item with meat and that one with fruit.

8
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,450
And I certainly don't want to hard code them there because that would be a lot of work.

9
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,760
And more importantly be our content is probably not static.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,520
So it's probably changing or can be influenced by the user.

11
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:55,190
So we want to output this list to view J S and turns out it's really easy to do so for outputting a

12
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,510
list like this view chess has the Wii for directive.

13
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:06,110
One of the last directives we haven't covered yet the four allows us like with a normal for loop to

14
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:13,620
loop through an array and replicate the element on which the force sits as often as needed.

15
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:19,990
And additionally all pull out the content in the array for the current iteration and use it in the template.

16
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,120
Let's see it in action here.

17
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:28,940
I WANT TO LIVE FROM MY ingredients so I can simply write ingredient this name is totally up to you in

18
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,760
ingredients.

19
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,100
This of course refers to my ingredients array here in the data properties.

20
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:42,560
So to any property which happens to be a list or iterable so ingredients to name I chose and I can then

21
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:50,360
use this variable which you view chairs creates for me during the loop with interpellation you for example

22
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,310
to output it.

23
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,690
Side note you can use it like you use any other property.

24
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:00,380
So it could also bind to the reference of a link I can pass it to a function call when listening to

25
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,090
event.

26
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:07,980
I can use it like any other property stored in my view instance just that I haven't stored but Mujeres

27
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,910
creates a dynamically for me instead.

28
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:16,360
So let's have control enter and see our beautiful iste with these few lines of code.

29
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:22,670
We're iterating through our ingredients here and outputting it in at an or at least with the before

30
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,460
directive.

1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:08,740
So back in the project I will run the development server here again and of course we don't see anything

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:16,300
here because it's empty and then after you file at first when I actually ate my data function to return

3
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:24,460
this data object I'm going to use and in this data object I now want to track the maximum number of

4
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,350
quotes and I'll set this to 10 as you saw in the demo.

5
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,790
And I also want to set up the array of quotes.

6
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:40,000
So a simple property name quotes which is an empty array at the beginning or maybe let's start with

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,360
one quote to have something to view.

8
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:48,790
So this is daz just a code to see some string because each quote shall simply be a string.

9
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,220
Let's say to keep this simple.

10
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,200
It could be an object if it had other properties.

11
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,360
But here I really only want to have the content.

12
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,580
So why not use a string.

13
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,120
This is my code.

14
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,560
Therefore with that I got the array I get the maximum number.

15
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:08,970
Well I'd say let's start working on this grid of quotes we saw before.

16
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,220
And for this all treat new components.

17
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,430
So in the components folder let's create the code.

18
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:23,200
Great view file which will hold this quote create anti quote dot you fall which holds a single quote.

19
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,240
I'll work on these two components next.

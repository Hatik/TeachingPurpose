1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:08,920
Let's start with working on the quote grid component here of course we'll also have my template and

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,150
then some script.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,750
I also want to have a style here.

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,550
So let me add that too.

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:23,210
And what I want to do is in the template remember here in the fall we do have a container where we will

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,680
nest everything in the end so a bootstrap class container.

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,010
So in there.

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,680
I therefore want to create a row div with a class row.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,300
This then hold my quotes now in here.

10
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,350
I will have my code component and I will of course use the force.

11
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,580
So a for loop to replicate it as often as needed.

12
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,890
Inside of that row.

13
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,980
Now what that also means is that I need to be able to get this array of codes from outside.

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:04,600
So in the script tag here I will export a default object and this default object your shell have some

15
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:11,050
props namely the quotes which are passed from outside so that I have access to them what the quotes

16
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:17,350
are whaleboat I can then lube fruit as soon as I have my code component and that is then what I'll work

17
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,400
on next.

18
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:27,400
So I'll copy this set up here and here in my single quote component I want to set up the panel body

19
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,820
script hearer's style.

20
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,980
You're excuse me because I will use this class here it's a bootstrap class and I want to modify it a

21
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,590
bit.

22
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:40,740
Specifically I'll change the font family to use the one I imported in the next age table file.

23
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:49,130
That's Arizona and I can do this by setting up Arie's So when you're like this and as a fallback style

24
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,210
simply have cursive.

25
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,660
I also want to set the font size to 24 pixels.

26
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,790
And I picked a color code which I found.

27
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,760
OK.

28
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,440
And of course stold is to your needs.

29
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,590
Now that is my single quote style for the panel body.

30
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:18,540
I also will add a quote class here where I simply want to set the cursor to be a pointer and when hovering

31
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:26,460
over it is I want to change the background color to does reddish look so that we can see we can deleted

32
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,550
with this.

33
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,970
Well that's just the styling.

34
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,640
Let's work on the actual quote.

35
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:41,650
Well here I actually you won't need an object all I want to have in here is not even the row.

36
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:53,310
It's really just a class A def of a class call and now let's say as six coal empty four and call Elgie

37
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,310
free for some well different style and different few ports.

38
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:06,160
And then in there I'll use the bootstrap classes panel and panel default to get this panel look basically.

39
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,450
So that gives it this round these round corners and so on.

40
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:17,280
And then there I will have a div with my panel body and all of my code class.

41
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,850
Now in that depth I simply want to have a slot because the code content should come from outside so

42
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:30,310
that the thing passing in the content is the thing deciding how it should look like here.

43
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:36,690
I'm only getting it creating the place where it will be rendered in the end but it should be the holder

44
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,790
of that Condon who decides how that should look like.

45
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:44,960
Now the holder of the content of course is to quote grid's year there.

46
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:51,820
I already have my quotes and the single quote component now being created I can next loop through all

47
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:57,630
words to render that single quote for each loop and pass the content to it.

48
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,820
Now try implementing that on your own.

49
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,560
I'll be back with that in the next video.

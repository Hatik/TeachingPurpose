1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,780
Let's implement the functionality to delete quotes for data.

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:14,190
First of all the app that you file one add the little info box telling me that I should click on a quote

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,940
to delete it for dad or use a bootstrap row.

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:25,230
And in that row simply a column which spans over the whole width and in their.

5
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:32,520
I also want to center my text text center is a helper class provide a bootstrap which does just that.

6
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,560
And then I will have an alert.

7
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:41,560
This is the box with the rounded quarter corner but do not make it read all at alert info class.

8
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:47,600
And then I can simply say in full click on a code to delete it like this.

9
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,330
Delete with lowercase D.

10
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,870
Now we see the box here.

11
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,970
Now to make quoad still eatable I need to make them clickable and then and when I click them I kind

12
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,450
of need to access my array year and delete the quote from it.

13
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,770
Let's do that next.

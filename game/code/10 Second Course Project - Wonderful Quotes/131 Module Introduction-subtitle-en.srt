1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:08,550
In the last modules we learn so much about component's time to bring it all together and build something

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,430
great with it.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,250
A nice little application.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,220
This is what we're going to build a quotes application.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,110
You'll see I really like quotes now in this application.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,850
We start with a quote and then we can add a new code like that.

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,770
So once we added You see we get 2 of 10 and the quote is added.

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:38,190
Now if I add a couple of our quotes here until we reach 10 quotes there you will quickly see that once

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:44,220
I try to add the 11th one I get an error that I should first delete some quotes so that we're not getting

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,560
too crowded here.

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,780
Well I can do the quotes by simply clicking on them and then you'll see it up it's up there and I can

12
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,870
start adding new ones again.

13
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,930
So whilst we only have one page here we're already using a lot of feature this year.

14
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:05,670
With that tracking of our estate the possibility to add and delete keywords and dynamically adding them

15
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,310
to our Dom here.

16
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,270
Well with that I'd say let's dive in and build this project together.

17
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:19,970
Of course if you want feel free to try out to achieve the same without watching me give you the solution

18
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:20,680
first.

19
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,330
You'll learn all the things you need here but of course all of you are free to join me on the solution.

20
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,840
And then stop at some point continue on your own.

21
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:33,330
Whatever works for you you'll find the set up for this project attached to this lecture.

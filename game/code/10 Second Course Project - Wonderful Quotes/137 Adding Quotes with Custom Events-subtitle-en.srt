1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:06,550
So we're at the point that we're able to create a quote here we're binding it with 288 abiding to the

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,760
quote property.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:13,030
Now I want to admit that to send this new quote to the parent component which in the end even though

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,820
I haven't embedded it yet will hold.

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,210
Didn't you quote here.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,080
And which handles all are quotes.

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:27,640
So a new quote here and create new I will call this emet dollar assignment to emit the quote added event

8
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,540
name is of course totally You're free to choose whatever name you like.

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,580
And there I will add this quote.

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,490
Remember this quote will be updated all the time because we're binding it to a binding.

11
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:48,760
Therefore eval also reset this quote After sending it so that the form gets cleared with this I'm emitting

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:55,260
this now in my apt view file in this root component there.

13
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:05,240
I want to implement this new quote component to do so and keep in mind in new quote We do have a separate

14
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:10,680
row so to do so here I will simply add a new component.

15
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,580
Therefore adding a new import.

16
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:23,020
First you quote from new quotes start to view and then down there registered as a local component app..

17
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:28,420
And you quote Shelby you quote here and then adding the selector up there.

18
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,830
And you quote like that.

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,830
If I save this we already see it here.

20
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,110
Looks a bit different than before but that's OK.

21
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:41,590
We do have the button here we can create it and now it would be nice too.

22
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,590
Well actually listen to that he.

23
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,180
So.

24
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,450
If I do enter a new one well it gets added to the array.

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,990
Let's do this to.

26
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,310
I already do emit Steve entier quote edit.

27
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,920
Therefore the parent component.

28
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:04,980
I can simply list and do quote edit on this selector and then execute new quote.

29
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:16,300
For example whatever you like as a name I will add my methods object here to set up the new quote method.

30
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:24,280
And of course here I actually do get some data passed to equate the data I do get passed.

31
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,500
Is the quote which was added.

32
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,330
So what fetched is here in this component to end user down there in the new quote method.

33
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:38,420
Well we learned that you Chessell automatically provide us to state on our accustomed events.

34
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,840
So here with new quote I can simply access to quote.

35
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:49,100
I don't need to change the event up here though I could also said it like this.

36
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,190
Bawler assign event like that but I don't need to do this.

37
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,120
Use it Jaspal do that implicitly so here can then use this new quote.

38
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,810
And how do I want to use it.

39
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:09,070
I simply want to say this quotes WIPs quotes push quote like that.

40
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,810
Well with this let's see if this works.

41
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,260
If I add something new.

42
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,990
You see it gets added here so we get this.

43
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,880
What's missing is different Chanology to delete a quote.

44
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,630
This info box at the bottom which tells us that we can delete the quote.

45
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:31,610
And of course the logic to handle or a stage to count how many quotes we have and to show the progress

46
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,030
bar.

1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:07,830
So we created the single quote component we got decodes perhaps being passed into Quba would create

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,750
from the app file.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:16,310
So with that here in the quote read I can simply use this single quote.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:24,600
Therefore of course I have to import it from the quotes dot view file and I have to register it in the

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,070
components property of this object here.

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:36,230
Now here I simply will assign AB quote as a selector code like this and then I'll use it as.

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:46,230
Quote Of course I want to use the form on this component here and on the form I want to loop through

8
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,290
all my quotes.

9
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:59,110
Now for that I will simply say quote in quotes and now I want to pastie content with simple string interpellation

10
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,920
between the opening and closing tag of AB quote because I want to use a slot thereafter.

11
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,260
So here I will pass code like that and if I save this.

12
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,110
Well we don't see anything because in my app you fall on using this.

13
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:22,810
So let's go to the app view file and import the quote great there from the components folder and then

14
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,540
quote to read the view file.

15
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,250
And let's registred there as a component too.

16
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:35,600
So when the components property we want to have our app code red which refers to this import that quote

17
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,530
CRID.

18
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:42,070
And then I can simply say ab go to great in the container.

19
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,400
Now I need to pass the codes to that.

20
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:52,240
So here I'll add a property quotes this attribute to the AB quote CRID selector because I'm expecting

21
00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:00,990
quotes as props here and then quotes is found with a colon at the beginning to the quotes array in there

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,140
so I'm passing the array to the word grid.

23
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,490
Now when I save this we see that single quote.

24
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,110
Not super beautiful right now but we're getting there.

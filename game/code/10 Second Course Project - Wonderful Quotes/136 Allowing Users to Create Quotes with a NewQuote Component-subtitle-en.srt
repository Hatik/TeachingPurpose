1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:10,360
Were able to display that quote here next I want to implement the method to add new quotes now for Dad.

2
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,360
I'll first add a new component.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:21,150
The new coach don't view file or copy the code from the quote read here and inserted there.

4
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:26,280
And now how he should is behave or what do we need in this new quote file.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,350
Well first of all I don't need to import the quote.

6
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,650
Second I don't need props and I won't have components in there too.

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,340
So let's empty this object for now.

8
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,660
Now what shall we have in a template.

9
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:51,070
I want to have a row and in this row I also want to have a div with a class of call as 8 and some offsetting

10
00:00:51,130 --> 00:01:05,820
for nice or styling column as an offset to call X as 12 call M.D 6 and call M.D of set free.

11
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,230
Now that is all brand new to you that are just bootstrap styles to make the grid look possibly as good

12
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:17,990
as possible on all different device sizes and withs mainly.

13
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:30,660
So inside here I want to have my label code and I want to have my text area.

14
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,900
Now for that to work I need to read everything here.

15
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,330
Enough for him.

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,610
Now we have learned about foreigns and I will come to them in the next course module.

17
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,350
Here is a very very simple preview.

18
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,700
It's not that hard.

19
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:54,680
So we have our default HMO reform task with our Cullom in there with the code label and the text area

20
00:01:54,690 --> 00:02:02,670
field and that text area gets a class of form control bootstrap styling and on the wrapping div we have

21
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,670
a form group.

22
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,650
Also a bootstrap style here.

23
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,220
A bootstrap class to get to some styling on that text area.

24
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:16,140
Europe want to set up three rows so that's a normal aged male attribute.

25
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,390
And then I will binded with you were binding to quote.

26
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,940
This is how you work with forms in future as you use that.

27
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,550
The mall thing and I'll come back to this in the next chord section.

28
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:33,170
We already learned about two binding though so it should be Robert easy to understand what's happening

29
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,840
here.

30
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:44,010
We need to set up the state of function return an object and in this object here there we want to bind

31
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:50,310
what we want to set up these quote property which is empty string initially to which rebinding binding

32
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,960
from the text area.

33
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:57,540
So this will get set with ENTRAR whenever we enter something here in this text area.

34
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,650
Well that's one thing.

35
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:05,670
The second thing is I'll copy this column here and there.

36
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:12,890
I only want to have a button with the button and Button primary bootstrap classes attached to it where

37
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,170
I say add quote no on there.

38
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:27,130
I simply want to add to click listener and say create new execute this method and I will add the preven

39
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:33,040
modifier to prevent the default behavior because I don't want to submit the form when I send the request

40
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,980
to the server that will reload the page.

41
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,130
I don't want that.

42
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:42,490
Instead I want to prevent a default and only execute to create new method which I'll now add here in

43
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,220
the methods key or object.

44
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:55,060
Here I'll have my create new Mefford ear sextile and in there all I want to do is I want to emit this

45
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,500
new quote.

46
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,270
Now we solve that the.

47
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,870
But I'll come back to this in the next with you when I finally will send.

48
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,830
To quote created here to the parent component.

1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,810
So let's try to solve it together.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:10,090
Make sure to download the setup for this project attached to the last lecture and the special thing

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,310
is that there we all get these.

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,510
Already ordered this handwritten font I'm using.

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,820
So let's think about this application.

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:25,520
How do we want to structure and which parts should this application have well it should have a header

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,480
this progress bar.

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,170
We also want a place where we create new quotes.

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:36,860
This text area and the button and then a place where we display all the quotes where each single quote

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,710
is a component on its own.

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,570
So we get four components thus far in header.

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,240
And you quote All quotes and then a single quote.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:52,390
Well and this in message at the bottom we can simply put it in our main rude object the apt Epcot view

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,550
file.

15
00:00:53,570 --> 00:01:00,950
This would be how we could structure that and how we could logically break it into single pieces with

16
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,770
their own business logic.

17
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:10,610
Well I'd say let's get started working on this grid and then adding the possibility to add new words

18
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:14,260
before we finished at all way of tracking the state.

19
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:19,520
So tracking the number of quotes and adding the progress bar to display the current state.

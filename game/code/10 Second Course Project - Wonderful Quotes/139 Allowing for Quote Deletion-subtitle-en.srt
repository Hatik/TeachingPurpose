1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,260
How can a track of a quote get clicked.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,290
Well we learned a couple of methods to react to that.

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:14,330
All used to one where I go to quote cret and here I do have my app quote.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,180
Now if I add and click like this on my own component that will not work.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:27,920
But what I can do is I can add the native mode of fire what the native modifier does is it tells Buquet

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,700
as well react to a click on that component.

7
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:38,510
If it happens on the native element of this component so aid will basically register a click here on

8
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,120
the day which in the end is what sets in GHG molecule.

9
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,840
But since we added the native property excuse me native modifier here it now is.

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,940
Yeah even though that happened on the aged him all killed off that component.

11
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:58,840
Treated Like I clicked on quote quote here which I can't because that is not appended to the DOM only

12
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,320
the code in the template is apparent to the dawn.

13
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:08,030
So this allows me to click on a component as a bold treat clicks on the template as clicks on the component

14
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:13,240
and I can therefore execute the delete quote method.

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:23,990
Now to delete to quote All I need to add my method to your an object where I add delete quote and now

16
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,310
how do I determine which code to delete.

17
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:32,010
I need the index of that code to delete the right one from the array to get the index.

18
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:37,480
I'll go to my the for loop and we learnt that we can extract more than just the element.

19
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:43,120
The second argument would be the current index and if we loop through an array the index is of course

20
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:47,790
exactly what I need to delete an array to delete an element from the same array.

21
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:53,120
Therefore I can hear PAHs index to the delete quote method.

22
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,520
I get the index here too.

23
00:01:54,530 --> 00:02:02,740
Therefore and hence I can use this to now also emit my own event and when I am at this event.

24
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,230
Let's give it a name of quote deleted.

25
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,980
I pass the index as an argument.

26
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Now with data I can go to the app file where I used this grid and in there I simply want to listen to

27
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,210
this.

28
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:25,720
So here I can listen to my own event the quote delete that event and execute delete quote here too.

29
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:32,070
The fact that I named this delete quote here in the Apter view file and in the quote CRID is totally

30
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,800
irrelevant.

31
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:39,100
The naming could be different because in the quote grid I execute this delete quote method and in the

32
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,990
after view file I delete the method I am going to create now.

33
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:51,020
So here I'm also going to create a delete quote method where I get the index as an argument.

34
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,460
I'm not passing it here because again beauteous will do that for me just as it did.

35
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:03,650
Or a quote added where it also passed to content for me and then down there in the lead quote.

36
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,860
I simply want to access my quotes array.

37
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:13,350
Use the splice method that starts splicing at the position of the index and then splice one element

38
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:19,840
to modify the existing array and simply remove one element from it.

39
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,190
Now with this I'm able to delete the quotes as you should see.

40
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,880
Once I had a new one click on it it's gone.

41
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,620
So this works fine.

42
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:35,770
And lastly let's add the functionality to track the number to give us a warning if we want to add more

43
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,940
than 10 and to show the progress bar.

1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:10,550
Well to implementor's properness bar all add a new component I'll name it header that you sort of file

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,700
is named heterodoxy view and then there.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:20,870
I want to set up this component or copy in the prepared template which you find attached to this file.

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,490
It's basically the normal bootstrap progress bar.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,770
So you can also head over to get bootstrapped dot com and fetch it there.

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,400
This is the progress bar without any content though.

7
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:37,840
The State of the progress bar is controlled by controlling the width of it.

8
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,680
You will see this in a second.

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,520
Now with this progress bar is set up I can go back to my apt audio file and here I want to import this.

10
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:55,410
So here I will import my header and add a new component app hador which uses this imported tatter.

11
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,340
And then in the view here I can simply add AB header like this.

12
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:12,960
Now for this to look good I also should give this a class of row here though and also wrap this in a

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,470
def spanning the full width.

14
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,190
So let me quickly do that at this end.

15
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:27,480
Now that's simply save us and we see the progress bar though it's empty of course because as I said

16
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:36,460
we have to adjust the width of this inner div here to control how far does progress bar has moved now.

17
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:41,310
We don't have any with set up right now so we don't see any change there.

18
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:47,460
For now let's change this to set the progress.

19
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:55,560
I'll add my script part to the single file where I export my default object here does the instance and

20
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,100
I'll set up my props.

21
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,110
And I want to get two props.

22
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,670
The quote count and the maximum number of quotes Max quotes.

23
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:09,470
I'll take care about passing this information pieces in a second.

24
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,250
I first want to use it.

25
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:20,700
I want to output some text in the progress bar the number of quotes to do so I will simply output the

26
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:27,550
code count and then also the maximum number of quotes.

27
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,200
Now notice it does slash year.

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,780
It's not a dividing that.

29
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,650
That's no operation no arithmetic operation.

30
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,910
We do have two different pieces of string interpellation.

31
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,360
That's just some text which will be displayed so that we see 5 of 10.

32
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:50,310
For example I also need to set the width and I will do this in a few lines and we can clearly see this.

33
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,840
I would bind to the style attribute with Colon style.

34
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,820
We learned this earlier too.

35
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:03,840
And here I want to dynamically set the width so with property off there is where the style of this does.

36
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,590
How do I set this.

37
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:12,630
Well I want to calculate the quote count divided by the maximum number of quotes.

38
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,670
So if we have five quotes and the maximum is 10 that would be top 5.

39
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:25,990
So I have to multiply with 100 to have 50 and then only two expressed as in percentages or 8 percent.

40
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,450
So I need to add plus percent.

41
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,940
This will be converted to a string and attach percent the percentage sign at the end.

42
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:39,730
So that in the end this will result to a style of with and then let's say 50 percent.

43
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,960
In the case of 5 items this is what will result from the spining.

44
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,250
Now to make sure that both quote count and maximum quotes gets passed correctly.

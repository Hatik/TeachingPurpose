1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:08,250
Well when a pass to quote count and the number on number of quotes I do both have at my apt or you file

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,020
Max quotes as hard coded and I do have my quotes array.

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:18,540
So I can simply pass this by pass saying quote count desisting name.

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:31,270
I gave the prop in your and setting this equal to quotes my array length and Max quotes can simply be

5
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,320
Max quotes.

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,030
This is what I named it down here too.

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,620
But then I'm passing the relevant data.

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,160
And if I saved this we already see this works fine.

9
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:47,420
The fact that it has this smooth animation comes from these years as classes you stared at all bootstrap

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,610
nothing programs here.

11
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:57,250
The last thing is that once I hit 10 I want to give myself a warning that a shell's first delete an

12
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,700
item before adding any more.

13
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:07,540
Well to get this I will simply go to a new quote method here and here I will simply check if this quotes

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,060
length is greater or equal the maximum quote number.

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,350
And if that is the case well then I will return and Erde way.

16
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:23,820
Whereas say please delete quotes first.

17
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:34,130
And with that in place can now see that if I add a couple of quotes here until I add the maximum I get

18
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,020
this warning.

19
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:40,720
And I have to delete some quotes before I can continue adding new ones.

20
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:49,430
This is the finished application using components to structure this nice looking app using slots passing

21
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,570
data around using a lot of the concepts we learned in the last modules.

22
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:59,840
So I hope you now feel really confident using components using all their features.

23
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,990
See how they connect to all the average things we learned from the course like binding to styles and

24
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,800
so on.

25
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,910
And with that we're well prepared to move on to the next course modules.

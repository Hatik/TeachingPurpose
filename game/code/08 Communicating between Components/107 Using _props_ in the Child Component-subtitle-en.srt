1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,520
So the passing of the property works fine.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:11,380
You can use props like it is important to note we not only output in the template of course we could

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:20,710
also have a method here so methods array where we have switch name and as a function where I simply

4
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:27,910
want to return this my name so I can access it with this like I can access any property in the data

5
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:36,280
property it set up in the same way this my name split because it is an array in the end a string is

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:43,660
just an array of character split with well an empty string so to split on each character then rewords

7
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,190
set and then shown it on each character.

8
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,260
This simply will reverse the name and that of course you're executed.

9
00:00:52,260 --> 00:01:00,630
So switch name and that will as you see work fine to say on Max of course.

10
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:08,340
The reason why it works fine is that I can of course use this props here like a normal property in my

11
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,310
whole view object they have down there.

12
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:18,240
I can access it with this I can access it like a normal brute like a normal property set up in the data

13
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,350
object.

14
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:25,920
This is so important to understand dessous why that is a perfectly valid way to use my props.

An import note regarding the naming of your props here I'm using name now I could also use Of course

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,490
my name.

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:15,760
Case sensitive here because I have a capital and inside of that I'm there for all.

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,280
Just the output here in my template.

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:24,570
And then any user component I can use my name with capital and here to know if I saved this.

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,250
It still works as you will see if I reload.

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,110
So that still worked.

8
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,570
However it only works because I'm using a single file template here.

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,060
If you try to use this in another template and we're not doing this in discourse because this is the

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:44,510
best solution to be honest then you can't use it because the DOM implications because Saddam restrictions

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:50,180
of having case insensitive attributes and elements applies.

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:57,320
So a case sensitive attributes like this will only work if you make sure that you're using a template

13
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:03,140
which supports this like a single file template we're using here which again gets compiled to shallow

14
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,790
script curing people process.

15
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,890
Anyways that's just something I wanted to highlight.

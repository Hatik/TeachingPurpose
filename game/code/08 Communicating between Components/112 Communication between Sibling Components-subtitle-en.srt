1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,990
So we pass data from parent to child and the other way around and we saw two different ways of doing

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,730
that with a customer event or using a callback.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,690
Now I went to get some data from one child to number one.

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,770
And how can we do this.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,850
We got to or depending on how you counted three different ways of doing so let's start with method number

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,820
one.

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:35,520
Let's say in the user added component here I will have a new button which allows me to edit D.H. here

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:44,450
I will have a new click listener where I say added age and I need to add an object to your where I say

9
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:54,400
or where have some methods one of them being at that age where I want to set some age to let's say 30.

10
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,460
But I don't have the age object there yet.

11
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:03,800
So I will store that in the parent component and the user component here in my data object and also

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,170
have an age which is 27 by default.

13
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:17,210
I went past us as a prop let's name it user age and refer it to the age in my data property to the user

14
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,520
added component.

15
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,560
This is how we learned it before.

16
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:26,150
And they're there for now only to set up my props and I'll keep it simple and stick to an array.

17
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,830
Don't want to set up validation here and simply named user age.

18
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,810
So this is just a name I'm using in my computer and here for the prob..

19
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,540
Now that gives me the age in the user edit component I can change it there.

20
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,900
And with that it will stay there.

21
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,880
Now let's say in user detail or is it want to output the age.

22
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:54,100
So there I also PAHs user age referring to this age in the data object again and in user detail.

23
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:59,620
I therefore added here user age which will be a number actually.

24
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:09,960
So let's set it up type number and in there I now want to get the update from the user edit component.

25
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:19,250
Now let's see this in action by adding a new field user age and outputting user age this prob I'm getting

26
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,230
there it is.

27
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:29,060
Loads we see 27 year and let's maybe also output it in the user edit component so that we can see the

28
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:37,090
current value we have there user age is user HOTU the prompt we're getting again.

29
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,390
And of course they also need to set this to user age.

30
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,740
Therefore since this is the problem.

31
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,870
So now if I click added age and well maybe load first.

32
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:54,940
So now victory EDID age here it changes to 30 in user edit component but not to user DTL component here.

33
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,050
There it is still 27.

34
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,220
And the reason for this of course is that the change only happened then the user added component were

35
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,490
not passing it to our parent component.

36
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,570
And we don't want to get to the parent component.

37
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,520
We only want to get it to let's say the user detailed component.

38
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:17,310
However as I explained on the slides this direct connection is not possible.

39
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,250
We have to take route over the parent component.

40
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:28,860
So one way to change it and that is the first way of doing so would be to set up a custom event we met.

41
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:40,390
So here when we added the age I also called emet and pass and he went named age was edited and passing

42
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,450
this user age as an argument here.

43
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:54,070
And then on the user component I can on my user edit component I can set up a listener with Ad Age was

44
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:54,970
edited.

45
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,360
There's a city name I'd shot chose here for the event.

46
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,260
And then the code execute I can simply say age equals dollars Sonnabend referring to the data which

47
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,640
was passed with the event which was the updated age.

48
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:16,480
Now with this emplace if I save this and go back to the application and reload it if I now click and

49
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:22,870
edit each year what's the age and the user detail component it was set to 30 now too because now we

50
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,320
take the following route.

51
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:31,600
We have the age set up in the user component and we pass it as a prop to both the user detail and user

52
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:37,750
edit component there after we change it in the user edit component and we emit a cast.

53
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,570
We went back to the user component there we were that he went we listened on the end or we listened

54
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:50,490
to this event and once the event is executed or happens we update the page in the user component.

55
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:57,770
Hence passing the new value down as a property to all components which use this property again.

56
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,510
Therefore also updating it.

57
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,180
Any user detailed component.

58
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,100
The second approach would have been to use this callback solution.

59
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,850
Now I'm not going to show it here.

60
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,560
We would have basically set up a method in the user component in the parent component like we did with

61
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:22,080
reset name then pass a pointer to that function like we did for the user detail component to the user

62
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,330
edit component as a property as a prop and then executed the user edit component.

63
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:33,030
So basically the same approach we used for the user name and reset name here.

64
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,810
I'm not going to show this because it's identical.

65
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:42,340
The third alternative however is brand new and this might be the solution you're looking for because

66
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:49,230
building these from child to parent to child Cheyne's can become very complicated quickly.

67
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:55,150
Imagine you got a child component in a child component in a parent component and you want to get to

68
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,120
another child component in an average child component.

69
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:04,200
So you have the child components as siblings and indeed child components have an average child component

70
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:09,040
then you would have to go from child to child to parent to child to child.

71
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,730
No that's no fun.

72
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,300
Instead we can use our event bus for days.

73
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:21,300
So kind of an object serving as a place to listen to events and passing data on.

74
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,770
Let's see how that would work.

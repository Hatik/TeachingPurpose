1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:08,710
I think this is a good place to stop and have a look at how data or information travels and a beautiful

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,900
application.

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,110
We've got a couple of components here apparent and free child components.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:22,450
Now generally if we want to reach out from one child to the other that does not work because our communication

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:28,870
is uni directional which means it only travels from parents to children or from children to the parent

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,380
but not from a child to an average child.

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:41,710
So instead we have to take the route that our parent gifts as some method we can execute when we execute

8
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,990
this method provided by the parent.

9
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,790
It was provided by a prop this will run in the parent.

10
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,480
Alternatively we would use a custom event to which the parent listened listens.

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,580
That is all possible.

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:03,310
And then the parent can pass the updated data to the child number three desist as uni directional data

13
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:03,770
flow.

14
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,070
I was talking about.

00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:06,450
Until now we already learned a lot about the basics of computing how to create them how to use them

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,040
how to set them up.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,680
Now I want to dive deeper into how components can communicate with each other so that we not just have

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:20,430
contained pieces of code where we can use all the chair's features but well don't really have connections

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,670
between the components but such that we do have such connections that we can communicate across components

6
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,670
something every real application will need for sure.

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,930
Now in order to do this I set up a basic application here and you will find the attached to this lecture

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,490
and beginning with the next lecture we will dive into that and learn how we can communicate across two

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,850
different pieces there.

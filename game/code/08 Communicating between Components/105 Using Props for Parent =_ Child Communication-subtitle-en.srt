1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:07,400
For transferring data from the parent to the child we use something called props.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,010
If you come from reality as you already know props it's a short form for properties and it basically

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,590
means properties set from outside.

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:23,400
So from the parent in order to tell our child to use or detailed component here that it will receive

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:30,700
data from outside that it will receive such props as deep props property to it to this object.

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,830
That's a property we haven't seen before.

7
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:39,660
This happens to be an array and in this array we specify a couple of strings wherein each string we

8
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,570
define a property which should be settable from outside.

9
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,860
So let's say name can be set from outside.

10
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,850
Important.

11
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,270
This name we give it here inside of the string has to match the property we're using in our template

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,390
because behind the scenes this will create a new property we can use just like a property we set up

13
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,310
in our data object but now implicitly because it will be passed from outside.

14
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,720
So this will give us access to name.

15
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,640
Of course we're still not passing it in order to pass it.

16
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:20,640
I will go to my user component and here for user detail I can now simply say name equals and then whatever

17
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,250
I want to pass.

18
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,870
Now here's something we have to watch out for.

19
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,900
I can use it like it is and old pass Max here so I'm not passing the name.

20
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,350
I'm changing with the button.

21
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,680
I'm hard coding a name I'm passing here Max.

22
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:39,310
If we save this and go back you see Max is actually displayed here.

23
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,310
So this works.

24
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,760
However it's not dynamic.

25
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:53,430
If I pass name here hence referring to my name property data property you will see it now print name

26
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,610
so it prints the string name and not the value of the name property.

27
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,940
This is because if using a name like this.

28
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,660
So just using the property we set up here will not be dynamic.

29
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,730
It will only pass the string to make it dynamic.

30
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,060
I use a colon.

31
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:20,010
So the BIND would be the alternative but I'm using the shorthand with this I'm now referring to the

32
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:27,150
Name property here like we do with all attributes we're binding to with colon and then name so source

33
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,190
on the image would have been in an a number use case where we used to call and to make it dynamic.

34
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,420
And we're doing the same here with our prop 1 to do this.

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,000
You now see next year.

36
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,300
And once I click on change my name you'll see a change to Anna.

37
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:49,130
Now we're passing a dynamic property using this per Obs concept important.

38
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,920
You need to call in here to make it dynamic.

39
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:57,860
And of course the name here has to be the same as the name you're setting up in this array here.

40
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:04,140
Otherwise you just know what to do with the attributes you are adding to use or detail here and what

41
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:04,680
it does.

42
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,770
I'm passing data from the parent to the child.

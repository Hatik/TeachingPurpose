1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:02,970
In this module.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,450
Learn a lot about cross component communication.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:14,360
And I really really dig into it because it's so key to understand how props work how custom events work

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:20,630
how buses work what the difference between primitives and reference types is how to pass data because

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,790
that's a day to day task in application using components.

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,100
Hope you feel comfortable using it and of that time to move on to the next module which actually is

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:37,640
the last module focused on components where we will learn some advanced or other things about components.

8
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:38,760
So let's move on.

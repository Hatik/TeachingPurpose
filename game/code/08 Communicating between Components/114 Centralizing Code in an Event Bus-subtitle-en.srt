1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:07,750
One more word to this event last year of course it would also be possible in the main chase follow we

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:15,700
create this new instance to add a method to your cell let's say name it change age.

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:26,330
And in this method to basically said this emit let's say we have to pass the age to the change age method

4
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:32,610
imitate event which is called age was edited as well and past age here.

5
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:38,270
So now we have Diomed logic in the event bus and then the user edit component I'm going to comment this

6
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:39,450
out too.

7
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:48,560
I can now simply use the event bus and call change H there and past is user age.

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,810
We updated here in the user edit component like this.

9
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:59,580
With this set up if I reload the app it still works as before.

10
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:05,660
And why didn't I show this to you because I want to show you that you can use such a view instance like

11
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:10,150
event bus you're generally to store some centralized code.

12
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,180
You want to access from different places in your app like here where we admit this event.

13
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:21,650
This makes especially sense if you have some code which you don't want to duplicate in different places

14
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,680
but instead what you want to store centrally.

15
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,960
You don't need to emit events all the time.

16
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,350
This could be any code here accessible from anywhere in your application.

17
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:39,110
As long as you import it and then well access to the methods you provide on this bus and the same would

18
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,150
be true for data you provide there.

19
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:47,510
If you set up some data properties here as a side note you're not as a function but directly set as

20
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:53,930
an object as it is a new instance if you set up some data properties here you can also access that from

21
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,910
all over your application.

22
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:04,730
So it's perfectly fine to use such a new view instance to centralize certain tasks submit data transport

23
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:11,960
data across your application and therefore outsource certain pieces of your code into such a central

24
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,760
place.

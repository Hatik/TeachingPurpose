1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:08,140
I'm back in the project we create a before it's actually in the same state as before I replaced by template

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,260
to only display Hello World and export an empty object.

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:18,820
Remember this will get compiled to a shallow script template Plus the new chess code where we don't

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:24,220
have any years since the object is empty but there could be some code and then were rendering this year

5
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:31,180
with the render method which basically is a beauteous method allowing us to override the template we

6
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,870
select here with the selector and then place our compiled template there.

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:43,300
So just an alternative to template to mention to say again but a better alternative because here we

8
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,610
render decompiled Javascript code.

9
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:53,050
Therefore we don't face the limitations template has like it having to be a string and Aberlour limitations

10
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,420
given by the DOM for example.

11
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:01,720
So this is the best way to write your templates as you get the maximum flexibility and I'll come back

12
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,040
to one specific piece of flexibility in the next videos.

13
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,770
Note that right now I'm not using a component.

14
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,940
This is a normal object and I'm rendering it here.

15
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,220
So I'm not doing anything here.

16
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,480
I'm not having a component here.

17
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:22,630
I know you can remove this export object and it still works because I still have to object to your DD

18
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,120
template.

19
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:29,210
I mean but I want to reintroduce the export object now in this object.

20
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,730
I want to set up my data and this shall be a function.

21
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,210
Let me show you what happens if it is not a function.

22
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,830
By the way this is not a component but it's a separate object which we're exporting here.

23
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,170
Right.

24
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,650
It's a separate object.

25
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,390
And we're rendering this object here.

26
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:48,610
So it has the same limitations as a component has because we kind of use it as a component even though

27
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,620
we don't have selector for that component.

28
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:56,770
But we're using it to reply as place our normal template here in an overview instance.

29
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:05,560
So if I set up data like this as a normal object and a set status to critical and then I print server

30
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,690
status

31
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,040
status here like that for now safeties.

32
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:19,050
You see we don't see it here but if I open up the console you see that data option should be a function.

33
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,870
So that doesn't really work.

34
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,110
Instead we shall set it up as a function as we learned.

35
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:33,360
And that in year return an object inclosing our status if I do this you now see the service status critical

36
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:33,910
here.

37
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,510
So that's generally how we work with that.

38
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:42,410
So far that's not totally new we learn about is single file components before.

39
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,270
Now let's also use them to create components now.

40
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,650
So I'm already exporting an object here and that is fine.

41
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:58,590
Does kind of now my route view instance which gets rendered here it's like a component which I don't

42
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:06,710
place with a selector but instead simply like a replacement for the instance object in here because

43
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,660
you're I use the render function to replace everything.

44
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:17,040
So I kind of need an alternative different place Verres set up my rude instance data efforts and so

45
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,370
on.

46
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,660
And this is in the App Store.

47
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,600
You fall.

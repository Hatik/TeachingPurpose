1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:10,260
Novel or component's reorganized here and having them with different letters and in a nice folder structure.

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,120
There's one other thing I want to mention.

3
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,300
We're not using the style right now.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,610
We're not applying any styles.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,700
Now let's change this let's add some styling.

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,660
Let's say the server details here.

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,230
There we do have a death.

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:33,170
And I want to give this idea of let's say a border of one pixel solid and red and then light servers

9
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:34,090
here.

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:41,050
I want to set up a diff style for this wrapping Dith where I set up a border of one pixel solid and

11
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,410
blue lead might not be super beautiful.

12
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,950
But let's see how this looks.

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,310
Oh everything is red now.

14
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:52,190
Well the issue is I only said the red style here on the server details.

15
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,190
Why is everything Borda red.

16
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,260
Now why was every day of select it.

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:03,020
The reason for this behavior is that we're not scoping the styles which means the styles are not contained

18
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:03,970
in this component.

19
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:11,180
By default any style we set up and any component will be applied globally like in a global stylesheet.

20
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,020
Now that might not be the behavior you want.

21
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:19,340
And you could easily overwrite it by adding scoped to the style tag here in your component in a single

22
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,750
file template and that will work in any single file template.

23
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,940
So do the same here in my servers and we had over.

24
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,120
You see now we get the borders only around us.

25
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,060
This is where we want to have them reload the page if you're not seeing this.

26
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:40,400
So with this we're now containing the styles we apply in a single file here in a new file due to content

27
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:45,080
of this view fall to this HD Ammal template there behind the scenes.

28
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,520
This emulates a behavior known as the shadow.

29
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,720
The shadow on basically means dead in the upcoming and upcoming browsers.

30
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,380
Basically the dom in there.

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,110
Each element has a dom B side behind this element.

32
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:07,430
So you not only have one global Dom but many sub Doms so that your age one take your normal HVM old

33
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:13,070
hag could have a different style in one place than in the natural place because there are due to different

34
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,880
Doms behind each of this H-1 tags.

35
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,630
Well that's something which we will probably see in the future.

36
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:25,660
Meucci emulates it today and we can see how it emulates it if we inspect this.

37
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:32,570
So if we inspect this Dave with the blue border we see we have this strange attribute being added to

38
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:32,890
it.

39
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:38,780
Data minus V minus and then some ID and the same is true for today with the red border.

40
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,920
Here we all got such an attribute with a different idea though.

41
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:47,840
You will see the idea stays the same within each component but changes across components like here between

42
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,010
the two different components red and blue bordered.

43
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,960
Now here we clearly see it.

44
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,700
This attribute which was added by beauty as we did place it there is important.

45
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:05,090
It's of course not a default HDMI attribute but it's also not one which is in conflict with any default

46
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,990
attribute.

47
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:12,110
Indeed it's using the default HCM alday the edge but which allows us to attach custom data to elements

48
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,910
so it's in line with a good HVM old style.

49
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,610
But where do we use this attribute for.

50
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:28,610
Well the styles we append here in our single files are in the end pulled up into the head of our document.

51
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,840
This is why here we see all these styles.

52
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:36,800
We set up in the single files attached in this section of the document.

53
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,660
This is something new Chesters for us.

54
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:48,350
Now here you see an empty style but once we click on the style of the blue and the red border these

55
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:53,060
two here you see the red border and the blue border.

56
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,550
This is the reason why before we only saw the red border because this comes second so it overrides the

57
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:04,550
average style and this makes sense because we load the server details after the servers because this

58
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,760
is how we ordered them their services are loaded first.

59
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,940
So this is how they are ordered.

60
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,620
And now you see future has added something to our selector.

61
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:19,940
It's now not only selecting by death instead it's selecting by death and the attribute and this of course

62
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,150
is the attribute also added in the bottom so to our devs.

63
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:30,500
This is how it emulates this behavior that our styles are only applied to the elements in a certain

64
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,370
component.

65
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,040
It adds our styles in the head section.

66
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:39,640
Adust is always for all our files which are which is the reason why we have these empty style text here

67
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,290
for the average components the other files we're using.

68
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:50,650
And then for the Fahd's where we have scoped added to our cell there it adds this ID to bouffe de-select

69
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,660
or any element in the dorm so that now the style is indeed scoped.

70
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,420
That's something to keep in mind and something to use.

71
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,470
If you want to make sure you're styling only gets applied one component.

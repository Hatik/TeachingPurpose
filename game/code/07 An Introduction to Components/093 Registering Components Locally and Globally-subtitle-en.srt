1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,790
Thus far we're creating components with you component here.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,280
This means in our app we're using it with a selector and we're adding them now if I create a second

3
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:17,790
app and therefore I create a second instance down there app too.

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,060
Now if I hit enter.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,350
Well we see it four times because our a second app here also now uses the same component.

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,240
What if we wanted to register different components globally and locally.

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:38,050
So we want to use the same selector maybe but use it or use different components in the end.

8
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,060
We can't do this to do this.

9
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,980
I'll do a little change here.

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,840
I don't call view component which registers it globally instead.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,540
Now I want to store this as a variable cell to do so.

12
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,830
I will say waar component equals.

13
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:01,420
And now does equal is just the object configuring decompile and so the selector is gone.

14
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:10,960
Now in my view instance I can now execute or I can add a new property components which basically touts

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:18,520
does instance which local components do you have some components only usable in this instance here.

16
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:26,380
Well and here I want to set up my selector does this now completely freely usable by myself my component

17
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,480
for example.

18
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,480
And I will refer to my component data up there.

19
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:39,430
Now I set up a local component and if I hit Control enter therefore the app breaks which happens because

20
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:44,860
I need to remove this unnecessary parentheses here coming from the component function but have an on

21
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,070
hit and try again.

22
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,850
We only see the service status in the first app because in the second where I also use my component

23
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,300
it's not registered.

24
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:58,570
We only registered it here on the first view instance with the component property on the second we don't

25
00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,260
have that.

26
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,920
So my component is not recognized there.

27
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,550
And this is how we can register it locally.

28
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,760
We could no longer just search on the second one Oulds use a different selector and thereby simply setting

29
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,710
up a different selector.

30
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:16,910
But if you want to do that this is how to do it if you want to use a global component instead.

31
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:23,950
Well then you need view component this method where you have your selector forest my component and then

32
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,770
your component object.

33
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:33,160
These are the two different ways of registering a globally with view component or locally with the components

34
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,870
property a view instance.

35
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,570
And with that now it's really time to leave.

36
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:45,640
A fiddle and work on these single file templates I explained before to see how we can use them in conjunction

37
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,470
with components of their.

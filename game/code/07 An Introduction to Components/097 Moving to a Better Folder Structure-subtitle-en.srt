1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:09,330
So any exercise of which you see the solution here I set up some Selecta this year registered locally

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,610
in my apt view file and I get all these files in the source folder.

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,530
Now these are two things I want to talk about now and restructure that and tell you which options you

4
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:20,850
have regarding that.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,920
Let's start with the structure having all these component files in your source folder.

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,180
Well make it quickly very crowded and hard to manage.

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:36,300
Therefore you want to create a sub directory and you could name it components to store your components

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:36,890
there.

9
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:43,650
So now we can grab all these subcomponents copy them over there and of course you need to adjust your

10
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:48,330
imports in the app you fall then and link to components.

11
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,500
And then this file.

12
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:56,070
So throw in this extra components folder that is one possible set up which is great for small to medium

13
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,300
sized applications for bigger applications.

14
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,300
You probably want to structure your folders by feature.

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,990
So then you wouldn't have a component's folder and yet you would have let's say a shared folder for

16
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,780
header and footer which are shared across multiple features maybe and then a service folder for your

17
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,900
server related components.

18
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:23,400
I'm not doing that here but you will see me do that in later stages of the coords when you build bigger

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,740
applications.

20
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,720
Because again this is a good practice and this will make it easier to find the file you were looking

21
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,810
for because we're only using a component folder.

22
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,050
Well that folder can get crowded pretty much soon too.

23
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:43,530
So therefore it then makes sense to have feature folders until we reach such bigger applications which

24
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,750
use our things than just components.

25
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:50,600
It's of course a fine solution to create some folders in the components folder.

26
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:59,040
So maybe like a server folder and then let's say a shared folder to now copy FOTR and header to shared

27
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,680
in there and then the average view in the server folder.

28
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,890
Again that's also a nice solution for very big applications where you're not and we have Capones but

29
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,500
some other things we will learn about you might remove the components folder and just work with shared

30
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,430
folders where you then have several subfolder for different pieces like components and other things.

31
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,670
So with these are Chessman someplace.

32
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:29,640
I of course need to add this new folder so shared forward the header and footer and then server for

33
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,670
the server and the server details here.

34
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,630
Let me quickly do that here.

35
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,680
And with that we restructured this to make it more flexible for bigger projects.

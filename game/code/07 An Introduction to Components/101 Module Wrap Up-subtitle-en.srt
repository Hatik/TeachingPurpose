1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,450
With that we learned all about the basics of components.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,590
We learned how to create them how to contain them in single files how to make sure that the styling

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,510
gets only applied to that component.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,420
How to register them locally and globally what are the advantages of single file templates art how to

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,260
structure our project and how to choose the selector names.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,050
A lot of very useful things you can now work with these components and use all the features you learned

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:34,210
in the early or modules in those cores like outputting data there and so on just like you did before.

8
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:41,100
Now in components now in the next much I want to dive deeper into components and learn how we can communicate

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,580
across components to send data from a parent to a child.

10
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,360
And the other way around let's dive into this in the next module.

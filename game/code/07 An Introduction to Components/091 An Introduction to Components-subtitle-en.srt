1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:08,140
I'm back in chess fiddle and even though I said we would use the seal from now on we will but this simple

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,130
introduction to come communes is best done here or it's very easy done here.

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:17,320
Asked Is this the environment you saw before it and as it will all be very little code.

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,410
I want to show you but the code that does show is very important.

5
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,120
Consider this application.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,700
We get a normal instance where we select a certain place in the dorm with the app selector but then

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,090
we override it with our own template down there where I basically say service status.

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,850
And then I use the status data property here.

9
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,260
That's a normal instance nothing could ish about that.

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,160
Now let's say we wanted to place this service status in various places here in the app as I showed you

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,150
in the last module.

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,780
That's not that easy to do.

13
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:53,050
If I repeat my app here besides that that it's not valid HD Maltzahn have multiple IDs.

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,670
You will also see it's only print that once and that does not because I'm using a DVR.

15
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:05,320
If I were to use class here and changes to dot app to select that by class you still see it's only getting

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,610
used to once the second usage down there is getting a minute.

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,520
That is because we're creating a view.

18
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,970
Instance here and with that and since we will only select the first element.

19
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,610
So this death here this day of up here.

20
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:24,640
Now we want to repeat this in our application because we've got multiple place where we do want to use

21
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,380
it.

22
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,370
That's actually easy to do.

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:35,050
I'll restructure it renamed this back to ID and then I'll get rid of the second instance but now I want

24
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:41,170
to indeed use a component which means I want to create a re-usable piece of not only template but of

25
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:41,800
our view.

26
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:49,990
Instance component basically extends the new instance and we can treat a new component by using the

27
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:55,750
view object and then running the component method on that behind the scenes.

28
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:01,940
This will give us a new instance Kind of but with some extra features.

29
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:08,200
Now the first argument and view component is the tag name which you want to use to enter a component.

30
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,660
You can't think of a component as our own age Tamal element we're creating.

31
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:18,460
So here I will set up component to use let's say my component like this.

32
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,740
This will allow me to enter my component in the code like this.

33
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:29,170
So creating or using my own HDMI element which I'm creating with that therefore makes sure to not use

34
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,520
an existing one.

35
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,040
Also make sure to add a prefix to make your component unique so that you don't interfere with any third

36
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,430
party packages you might use or existing or possibly future aged female elements because you certainly

37
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,190
don't want to overwrite them.

38
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:50,750
So maybe use your company company name as a prefix or at least something like app or my.

39
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,610
So that's the selector by which we're able to use this.

40
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,330
The second argument is the actual object which represents a component.

41
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,730
And this is generally the same object as the object we're passing here to our view instance.

42
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:11,590
Therefore I can copy data template to this object here to use that and I will change this to a hash

43
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,240
tag so that we will again select this part in the dawn.

44
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:20,010
But this will not work as intended.

45
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,840
The reason for this is the data object and the component component basically extends the view instance

46
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:32,440
and therefore if we set up data like this we kind of interfere with the average data properties our

47
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,080
data objects.

48
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:41,650
Hence you chaps will actually give us an error or if data is an object it's fine or it's normal to use

49
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,290
it as an object in our root instance.

50
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:53,090
But in any component this shall actually be a function where we then return a new object holding the

51
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:53,640
data.

52
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,710
So this data object we use for is not basically returned in a function.

53
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:06,050
So by wrapping it in a function we make sure we're not interfering with our data.

54
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,720
So with this set up for now in control enter we see the service status critical here and we see that

55
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,480
our component is now used successfully.

56
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:23,440
So we're now able to output it because we can now also repeat that if we would have it in multiple places

57
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,060
like this and that is what makes components so cool.

58
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,330
You have your contained new instance your contain code.

59
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,540
Of course there you could also have methods computed all the things you already learn about.

60
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:43,450
Which is why I taught them first but now you have it contained in this component which you can enter

61
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:49,670
as often as you want into your template here into your code to reuse it.

62
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,740
And that gives you a very powerful tool to build your web pages.

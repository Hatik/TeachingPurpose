00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,320
Walk into a new module we traveled through a lot of the features Eucerin offers us.

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,110
We'll learn about how we can interact with the DOM how we can use events and how they view instance

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,830
works.

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,800
All of that is extremely important and still valid.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,610
Now that we learn about components the components are a major piece of view Seamus and all the other

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:31,230
things were basics we needed to understand how components work and we use the same basics with components

7
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:38,640
but now components introduce a whole new feature to our view chess application namely the feature to

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,300
create real usable pieces in our application which we then can dump in in different places in our lab

9
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,300
to rerent or the same kind of code or business logic in different places.

10
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,500
Now we'll see this year in action and we will learn how we can use components which different ways of

11
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,560
using we have how we can register them how we can let them interact with each other and much more.

12
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,700
So let's dive in.

1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:08,450
Now let's create a new component for that I will create a new file in the source folder and I will image

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:13,180
home that you know in there we need a template.

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,940
We need a script and we might need styles.

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,320
Now let's stick to template and script no template.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:30,350
I want to output my server status as before and I want to set it to status using this property binding

6
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,380
exclusionist strings appellation.

7
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:39,850
And here I want to export an object export as default since it is the only export in this file.

8
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:46,110
And here I want to have my data field which again is a function where I return an object whereas status

9
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:56,020
is set to critical as before it and I want to have my methods where I now also have an object defining

10
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,930
my methods.

11
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:01,470
And now we can use it as 6 cents in this project.

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,470
It is getting compiled to ESX or two is five.

13
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,770
We can use iOS 6 to get a composite.

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,970
Ears 5.

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:15,180
Now in iOS 6 I can also write a method in an object not like by writing.

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:24,280
Let's say change stators colon function but instead by simply writing change status parentheses like

17
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,790
this like a method call kind of this creates the same.

18
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,400
Just gives us a method we can execute.

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,060
And in here I want to set this status.

20
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:38,170
Remember we can access the status even though it's an object returned by a function.

21
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,520
You chaps takes care of it.

22
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,820
We still can access it and it can set this status to normal here.

23
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,630
Now with that I got a function I can execute.

24
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:51,310
So in here I'll add a horizontal line and then add a button.

25
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:59,820
And here I want to say change status and use at click and execute change status down there.

26
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,010
Now with this set up I gave up my component.

27
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,640
Now I want to use it.

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,260
How can I use it.

29
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:14,620
We can't even work registred globally in the main Shiahs file here by saying view component giving it

30
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:24,370
a selector let's say app server status to have a unique selector and then the object that's named home

31
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,400
for dead.

32
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,540
We will need to add an import.

33
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,880
I'll name it home.

34
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:33,780
This name is up to use since we export only one object you export default.

35
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,370
We don't have a name here.

36
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,830
So we may choose any name when importing it and we have to imported from the same folder.

37
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,700
Therefore dot slash or well-packed find it home dot view.

38
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:54,040
Now with this set up I can use apps service status as a selector in my whole application.

39
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,490
Therefore also in my root file here.

40
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,890
So I'll add observer status here.

41
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:05,000
Remove the data object remove the whole export script here maybe even and we're getting an error.

42
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:10,800
The error we got here is a key thing we have to keep in mind.

43
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:16,530
It's just component template should contain exactly one root element and that's pretty clear.

44
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,950
This is not allowed.

45
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,870
We may not have free or two or any amount of sibling elements.

46
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,330
Instead we only have to use one.

47
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:33,220
So this can be a div and then we have to wrap everything else inside of this element the template element

48
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,220
doesn't count because that will be removed in the end.

49
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,180
This is one restriction with face.

50
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,500
It's not too bad though.

51
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:46,690
But it's important to keep in mind wrap all your template code inside of one root element.

52
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,530
This is key.

53
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,300
Otherwise this will not work now.

54
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:58,560
And with that if you save it it recompiles and you see service say that's critical in the browser now.

55
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,520
And if we change it it gets changed to normal.

56
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,490
So that works as intended.

57
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:10,960
The key thing to keep in mind is it has to be one root element and then we're able to register our application

58
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,760
or our component as a global component like this.

59
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:20,170
But this one root element restriction also applies for local components.

60
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,280
It applies for every component.

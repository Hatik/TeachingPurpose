00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,430
So over this module you'll learn a lot about access.

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,230
A very popular alternative to new resource.

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:17,150
You can use access in any javascript project and therefore also view projects now.

00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,660
You'll see that Xs offers many great features like global configuration interceptors custom instances

00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:30,560
and of course that using it is as simple as calling one method and then using the method to handle the

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,190
incoming response exis is very popular and I recommend looking into it.

00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:43,220
If you want to dive deeper into it of course the place to go is the official documentation which you

can find on the Get up page for access.

9
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,880
It's a great place to dive deeper and really fine tune it to your needs.

10
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,860
So I hope this was helpful.

Let's continue with the other modules den.

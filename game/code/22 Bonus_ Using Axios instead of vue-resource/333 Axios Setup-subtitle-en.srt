1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:08,720
So in the last lecture we set up our project and the firebase back and let's now install X yes.

2
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,510
As I said it's a party package.

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:16,950
It's not integrated into view so all Quittner lie NPM run def Burroughs's for a second.

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:24,020
And in the terminal all now run NPM install dash dash save to also store an entry in the package dodgiest

5
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,860
and fall X. Yes that's the name of the package.

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,070
As a side note if you want to learn more about this package and dive deeply into it don't miss a chance

7
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:38,560
to wizard its web page on get up dot com or it's repository I should say.

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,430
You can simply search for access and get up and you should instantly find this.

9
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,180
There you will find detailed instructions about installation about the usage.

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,120
The whole API and so on.

11
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,750
But of course I'm going to show you the most important things here.

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:59,230
So with that I installed Yes I can now rerun NPM run death to go back into my development server mode

13
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:06,460
and into watch mode which was just my coat with excess installed the first important thing to note is

14
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:12,300
that we don't add it or don't have to use it on our viewer app.

15
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:20,260
So unlike the router which we use with viewer use or the store which we use with you as view x axis

16
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,500
is a third party package and by default not integrated into view like this.

17
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:30,560
Now there actually are packages which bind access to view and then give you access to it on.

18
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,430
This instance so in any component with the this keyword.

19
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,570
But I want to show you the wrong way of using axes.

20
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:44,620
You can always look into Albert for party packages if you are interested in more deeply integrating

21
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,830
x' interview.

22
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,290
But for now let's just stick to the role library itself.

23
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:55,930
So the goal is to submit data on the Sign-Up page and then later I want to be able to get this data

24
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,120
on the dashboard page.

25
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:05,770
So this simple way of using Access in the sign up page is to just make it actually be request through

26
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,730
a package from there let's do this in the next lecture.

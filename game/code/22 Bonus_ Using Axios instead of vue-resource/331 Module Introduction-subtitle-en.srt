Welcome to this module.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:12,790
This module is about X years popular package for making H-2 repeated requests from javascript applications.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,510
So it's not specific to view.

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:20,300
You can use it in any javascript application but of course beauty has uses Javascript and therefore

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,810
you may use X years in new applications.

6
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:29,680
It's essentially an alternative to the new resource which you learn about early Endace course.

7
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,810
And here's one thing I definitely want to point out.

8
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,930
There is nothing wrong with using view resource.

9
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:42,950
I covered it in this course because it is also a popular pick for applications but if you don't like

10
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:48,080
it or if you want to use Access because you know it from other applications or because it looks interesting

11
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,730
to you feel free to do so.

12
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:50,910
Both are fine.

13
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,560
None of them is secure or not recommended or anything like that.

14
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,370
You may choose whichever you want.

15
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:03,800
So with that let's cover access let's learn how it works and how we may integrate it into a view application

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,290
in this module.

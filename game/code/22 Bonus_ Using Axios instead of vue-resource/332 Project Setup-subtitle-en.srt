1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:06,320
In order to work with X-ists we need an application.

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:12,970
And I actually created a very simple new application which you can find attached to this project simply

3
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,930
download and extract that run.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,750
NPM install in the extract folder and then run and run death.

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:26,330
I used DB use Seelye and the web page simple template to create an application.

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,030
Now once you open the application it should look like this.

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,360
It's a Web page where you have a sign up a sign it and a dashboard page.

8
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,090
All of these links work by default.

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,150
You can also go back to the welcome page.

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:45,190
Now one important note here this page of course looks like you can actually sign up and sign in.

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,170
Right now though you can't that's something important.

12
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,640
We will however in a later module also add authentication logic to this.

13
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,170
That's another part of the course update.

14
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:03,100
Additionally will also make sure that we validate the user input in this form year.

15
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,550
For now however I will focus on the axioms.

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,100
So on the send data to HTP part.

17
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,290
So that is what we'll cover in this module.

18
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:19,190
That's the application we got it's finished from you all perspective.

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,230
But of course it doesn't have a lot of logic in there.

20
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:29,100
Now what I want to do in this module is I want to add some code here in my Sign-Up though you fall where

21
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:38,330
we fetch a lot of user data and add code to actually send dead data to the backend to some server essentially.

22
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,560
And I want to do this with access now as a back end.

23
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:49,080
I want to use firebase you can of course use any back and any restfully API but firebase is that easy

24
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,480
to use rest API essentially.

25
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:57,180
So what you can do is you can simply go to the consul there and even use an existing project or add

26
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,260
a new one.

27
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:05,780
And once you did create this new project make sure to go to database on your firebase back end there.

28
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,160
Pick the real time database they nowadays have an option year but let's stick to that.

29
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,610
Click on get started and there's one important configuration you need to set under rules.

30
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,660
Make sure to set both read and write access to true.

31
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,630
That basically grants everyone read and write access.

32
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,070
You probably don't want this for your production application but we want this now.

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,730
We will in one of the next modules though change this to only grant access to any kind its users.

34
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:39,860
So with that let's go back to our application and let's start working on our view application.

35
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,190
Over the next lectures let's use xes stair.

1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,790
We learned about the basics of using Access with GET and POST.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:14,120
Now one thing we do right now is we read was the same base your l like this one here.

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:20,360
Actually we reused the same entire Eurail else older users Chaisson us the same and sign up and dashboard

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,210
component.

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:27,260
But let's pretend that this would be different and that we only had the same base your L though what

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,920
I will show you would all the work if you copy everything.

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,930
What I want to show you is that you can set up a base your L when using x.

8
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:42,290
Yes let's do this in the main door Jaspal simply because it runs as the first fall before our component

9
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,700
code runs.

10
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:51,380
So here I will import x years from x Yes and you could outsource the logic I'm writing here into a separate

11
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,140
file if you wanted to.

12
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:58,540
Now as I mentioned earlier you don't need to and you can't use you use here.

13
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,420
So what do we do instead is we just x x Yes.

14
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,260
And now we want to set a base u r l on x yes.

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:13,220
You can simply access the defaults object as the name suggests doesn't an object x is ships with which

16
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,450
allows you to set up some default settings and the settings you set up here.

17
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:24,500
It could also be set up as request specific settings by passing a second or third argument to to request

18
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,480
this javascript object.

19
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:33,230
So there you could set up options for this specific request here we're setting up clonal options which

20
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,570
will be applied to any request.

21
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,420
Now what can we do on this default object.

22
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:45,530
A full list of things you can configure it can of course be found on the access documentation there

23
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:51,850
if you scroll down you'll find details about the request configuration you can apply.

24
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,020
I will focus on the base you are.

25
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,700
There is one key you can set up here.

26
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:04,540
You can set base you are out with you are all being capital case characteris and then you set as equal

27
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,550
to a string.

28
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:09,610
Here I will cut this code to cut the string.

29
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:16,660
So really remove it from my dashboard and you fall and enter it into this space you are all in the manger.

30
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,390
Yes.

31
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,310
And I'll also go to the sign up of you fall and get rid of this your L here too.

32
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,800
So that in both Falls.

33
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,620
I only have deposit I want to access and since that's the same payoff we could actually also extract

34
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,040
that.

35
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:35,290
But I'll leave it there for demo purposes so that we don't just have empty requests here.

36
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,400
So we now get the base you are all set up here and that's all we need to do.

37
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:46,710
As I mentioned earlier Access which you import here is the same shared instance across all your files.

38
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,720
So setting's you set in the main dodgiest file will effect the x' instance Euston dashboard sign up

39
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:59,290
or any Arab place in Europe so that we can go back to our application and we can already see it if I

40
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,300
reload.

41
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,030
We don't get an error or.

42
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,330
Well obviously we would get one if we would now target an invalid you are l.

43
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,930
So that's the first important thing I wanted to mention.

44
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:17,170
You can set up configurations either on a request level or as shown here on a global level and feel

45
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:23,150
free to dive into the next year's documentation to learn about all possible things you can set up here.

46
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,780
One common configuration I want to share with you is the configuration of headers.

47
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:34,620
They are on the default object to make it or to configure it for every request.

48
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,700
You can also set up default headers.

49
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,730
Actually you can add something to the default headers.

50
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:46,050
Exes will always set up some the full headers but if you want to pass some specific headers you can

51
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:50,070
set them up here and access will merge them there on headers.

52
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:55,430
You actually got the choice between a couple of header specifications or targets.

53
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:01,620
You can't use common to set up headers which should be applied to any request no matter which type it

54
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,540
is there or you can then set up your own header by adding a new property like this.

55
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,010
For example you offer I sation header.

56
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,820
You're free to add any header you want and then set this to something.

57
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:21,140
This could be a good way to pass some generic token to the back packet on every request.

58
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:27,850
If you got more specific read needs you can also target headers but there for example just target gets

59
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:34,590
requests by targeting get and then adding some specific header here.

60
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,350
So then you could also set up something like this.

61
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:47,890
With that in place if we now go back to the application and I reload this page you'll see it works as

62
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,740
before.

63
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:54,240
But if we inspect the network tab here where we can see is quite interesting.

64
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:03,970
There if I inspect this request to users Jason and they go to header's you can see that on the request

65
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,630
hetero's at the bottom does offer a say she wants passed.

66
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,950
And since this was a get request you can also see that excerpts will set to application.

67
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:19,190
Jason that's very interesting and this is a novel cool way of setting some global conflict.

68
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,280
So overall the key takeaway of this lecture is you can set up conflagration defaults.

69
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:31,440
You could also set all these things on a request level on a per request level by passing it as an additional

70
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,590
argument to your request Moffats.

71
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:40,380
But being able to set up some global conflict can save you a lot of time and make your code easier to

72
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,110
maintain.

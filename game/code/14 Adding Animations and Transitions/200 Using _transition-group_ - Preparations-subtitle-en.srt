1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:09,040
Know to use group transitions I'll add an humorous line here and then I went out put out an order list

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:14,590
I'll add de-list group class which just gives to some nice bootstrap styling.

3
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:21,790
And then my list item to you list group item class here again just to have a nice style being applied

4
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,380
to it like this.

5
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,370
So this is my list item and now I also need some data.

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,420
I will say that a simple array of numbers here because it's not really about the data it's about the

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:36,230
animations which Shelby the number is 1 3 4 5 let's say.

8
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:46,250
And I want you loob freedom of course so I will add the for loop for my number in numbers like this.

9
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,000
And the output the number here with string and tribulation.

10
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,920
Having a look at this we see this list down there looks great.

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:01,000
And as we know it now I want to add a way to add and delete items and then as a last that we want to

12
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,350
animate this.

13
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,730
Now let's add a way to add and delete the items first.

14
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:17,360
Here I will simply add a new button button button primary which will get the add item caption and then

15
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:23,810
upon clicking I want to execute an item a method I have yet to add and on the individual item I want

16
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:30,580
to add a click listener so that when I click on an item I execute remove the item and therefore remove

17
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:37,940
items I need to know which item and to be able to know I will adjust this code a bit Richenda over multiple

18
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,590
lines too.

19
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,450
So it is easier to read and I will get more arguments than just one.

20
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,650
We learned this we can always retrieve the index of the current iteration like this.

21
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,640
And then I can pass this index like this to know which items shall be removed.

22
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,750
Now I get these two methods.

23
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,610
I don't have set up right now.

24
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:02,300
So let's set them up next to make this work though before doing so I will add some style here to make

25
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,730
the cursor a pointer so that when we hover over them we can see that we actually can click them or should

26
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,410
be able to click them.

27
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,460
Now let's add the two methods here.

28
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:17,780
The two methods are an item which doesn't take an argument and then remove an item which has the index

29
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,690
of the item as an argument.

30
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,620
Now removing is very simple.

31
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,070
I simply get my numbers right.

32
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:30,200
Does this property as set up here in my data which is just an array and then have to splice method I

33
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:37,340
can edit this existing array to remove item for example and I want to remove the item at the index and

34
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,530
then only one item to remove just the item at this index.

35
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,870
This is how I remove the item.

36
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,260
And we can already see this action if and I'll click on an item it's gone.

37
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,150
And then for adding a item I went to randomize this.

38
00:02:53,150 --> 00:03:00,890
So I want to get a position which all determined randomly with more floor to get a full integer and

39
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,110
then ma friend them.

40
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,410
Which gives me a random number between Ciro and Dot 9 9 9 9.

41
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:13,880
And this multiplied with the current length of my array will give me to get with more floor some number

42
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:21,620
between 0 and the highest indexes of the last item in disarray which is exactly what I want to have

43
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,750
a position to add it at.

44
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,540
And then I can simply use the splice method here too because it can not only be used for moving elements

45
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:35,450
but instead I want to start splicing at the position here don't remove any element which is why a pass

46
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,970
0 as the second argument.

47
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:43,210
But then splice also has a third argument which allows me to add a new element to desir at dispositioned

48
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,780
and so here I want to add this number is length plus 1.

49
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,510
This is important so that I don't add a number which are currently as part of the array.

50
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:58,250
Now we can see this in action by simply starting to add here and you see these numbers like the 7 here

51
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,390
are added in random places.

52
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:00,900
Nice.

53
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:08,450
The last thing is I want to add a horizontal line after some breaks after the button yours so that we

54
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:11,750
do have a nice separation here some distance in between.

55
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,980
And now I went to Eddie made both the addition and deletion of items.

56
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,730
This is what I'll work on next.

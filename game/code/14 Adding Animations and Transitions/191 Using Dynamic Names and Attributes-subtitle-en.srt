1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:08,090
Number for moving on and seeing the transition from one element to another let me conclude this first

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:13,910
basic introduction here by showing your dead name here doesn't have to be static.

3
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,520
You don't have to hard code it here.

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,320
Indeed.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,880
Let me add a line break here and add a Select up here to select control.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,480
Now want to head out I have the option to switch between the fade and the slide animation so that we

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,180
can choose this.

8
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:37,130
Now we already learned how to get this value with the model and I want to bind it to a property year

9
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,960
which I will name alert any mation now.

10
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,730
Any mation by default here.

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,100
Shelby let's say fate.

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:53,600
Now with that I can now bind here to alert any mation with the model and this will set this depending

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,170
on what I choose here in my dropdown for this to work though I will need to set up my values here.

14
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,640
So two faced and to slide.

15
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,140
These will be de-evolved justis property then takes in the end.

16
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:12,540
And now I can by End name here dynamically by exchanging name like attribute with as we learn it.

17
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,790
Attribute binding with a colon in front of it.

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:23,420
Now this will make this property here being bound dynamically and of course here you then entered the

19
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,500
property name which has de-value want to bind dynamically.

20
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,600
That's the idea behind dynamic binding ridable or debt.

21
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:35,900
Now if Dad let me just add another line break and add the form control bootstrap class here to make

22
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:41,600
it pretty and if we look at this you see now Fader's select that hence the first alert for fades in

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,170
and out.

24
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,120
But it can switch just to slide.

25
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,400
And now it slides in and out.

26
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:54,390
There we see the issue year we fix before by specifying what should talk all the way this transition

27
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:54,980
works.

28
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:00,590
So the type here is set to animation down there for the one slide animation while we don't set it here

29
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:07,010
when we dynamically set this to slide so we could also set type dynamically therefore with type.

30
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:12,260
You can bind all attributes like this Indian but for now I will leave it like this.

31
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,780
Because the key thing is that you understand that you can bind these properties these attributes are

32
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,520
set up here.

33
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,690
The same is true of course for these classes here.

34
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,320
You can bind them dynamically by adding a colon in the beginning.

35
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,720
He used them like normal HVM out attributes.

36
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,650
This is the important thing I want you to take away here.

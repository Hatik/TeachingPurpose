1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,340
So we want to face this alert in and out.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,450
How does this work.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:06,520
Let's start with faith.

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,100
Enter.

5
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,600
Remember this is D.C.'s S-Class which is only attached for one frame at the beginning.

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,370
So here we should set our initial stage.

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,640
We want to have.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,850
Now since you want to fade it in it should initially be transparent.

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,930
Therefore here I will set the opacity to zero.

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,710
And that is all.

11
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,930
I'm not setting up any transition year or something like this because keep in mind disclosable will

12
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,480
immediately be removed after one frame.

13
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,760
So if I would set up a transition here that wouldn't work.

14
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,510
The place to set up the transition is your fate and act of class here.

15
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,870
I want to transition my opacity.

16
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:47,330
You could also transition all if you wanted but we only want to transition the opacities are just fine

17
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,260
and I want to transition over one second let's say.

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,650
Pick any time frame you want to pick.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,250
Now this will animate it.

20
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,700
Now I'm not setting a pace that he won here and that is important.

21
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:04,970
Oh basically one is the default anyways because keep in mind opacity Zero Year will be removed after

22
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:05,580
one frame.

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,660
So we don't need to overwrite it it by default is fully opaque.

24
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,390
So we do have we don't have to specify one here.

25
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,490
And indeed if we were to set your pace to one here the thing that would happen is that we would instantly

26
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:26,130
overwrite our initial state of zero which yes was removed but it was there when we added this transitional

27
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,790
opacity thing year because that gets added right before this gets removed.

28
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,960
So we would remove this or override this immediately to 1.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,850
Therefore we wouldn't see any fading because the opacity would always be one.

30
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,970
So it's important to not set it here only set up the transition here.

31
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:49,480
Well and for leaving here we could set opacity to one though that is the default already.

32
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,770
So I'm going to comment it out.

33
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:57,130
We don't need to set it for Faid leave active though we again should set up the transition.

34
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:02,500
And now here it is important that we also set up the pace at your 0.

35
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,020
Remember the default already is 1.

36
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:11,220
So by setting up both the transition and the opacity of zero we tell at least any made whenever the

37
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,460
opacity changes.

38
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,430
Oh and look here it changes G-0.

39
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,180
This is how we can control this.

40
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,600
And now with that set up and the name being added here.

41
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:28,040
Hence making sure as fate enter and so on get attached by the U.K.'s future as is now able to sniff

42
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,600
DCs as classis finds out that the transition length is one second.

43
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,600
We don't have any mation so it uses transition with animation of course I'm referring to Theseus as

44
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:43,870
an animation property which would be an alternative to transitioning here and it does the same for the

45
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,660
Leaving hand knows how to how long it should attached.

46
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,390
As classes well and with dad.

47
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,180
Let's see.

48
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,030
Let's have a look at the running application.

49
00:02:53,030 --> 00:03:00,410
Make sure your development server is running and you need to this and now you see it fades in and it

50
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,400
fades out.

51
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:06,430
And now we already set up our first animation for a single element.

52
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,850
But how cool is that.

53
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:13,970
Now in a next venue Let's have a look at how this would work if we wouldn't use the transmission property

54
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:19,580
here but instead see it as animations which is the alternative to transitioning single properties.

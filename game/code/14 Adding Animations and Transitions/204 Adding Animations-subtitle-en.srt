1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,050
So the application is working but it's not really pretty.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,480
This instance snapping here now we can animate this.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,290
So let's do that.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,820
I actually will use a simple transition as we learned it.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,580
So here I will add.

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,560
Transition like this.

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:26,490
And then for this transition I want to set up a name and the name is fliped because I want to flip this.

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,980
Now it could also dynamically bind this to some property if I wanted to switch the transition and that

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,120
could be a nice challenge for you to do.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,110
But hirable hard code it and it will set the mode to out in sort of the old component is first removed

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,610
before the new one is animated in.

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,030
Now of course since I add Phlip here I need to add a couple of.

13
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:53,940
See us as classes down there specifically I need to have Phlip enter but as a side note of course you

14
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,170
don't need to have it if you don't enter any code in there or just want to show which classes we could

15
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:58,920
use.

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,530
Flip ENTRAR active.

17
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,750
And then of course we also have Phlip leave whip's like that

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:14,110
and of course also Phlip leave active like this.

19
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,370
These are the classes and since I want to flip it I will need some keyframes to use a C as s animation

20
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,220
to do that.

21
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:29,640
So hearable have flipped out from and and let's say of course you could be more granular by specifying

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,690
in-between steps.

23
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:38,160
For example and I will also have keyframes Fulop in like this.

24
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,950
And here I also want to have simply from and to now which animations do I want to set up here.

25
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:53,640
Well for flip out I want to transform and I want to rotate twice a rotate around the y axis which is

26
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,580
this animation so Knot's not x y rotate Y.

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:06,150
And initially I want to rotate at base 0 degrees because I will start at having it well not rotated

28
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,100
at all.

29
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:15,360
That having it really like this not like this not like this really at zero degrees but I want to transform

30
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:24,950
to rotate wide 90 degrees so that it now is from this switch to this.

31
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,800
Of course you want to do a full flip and the other half will be done and flip in because that should

32
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,150
already be the new card.

33
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:37,510
The new component if it would animate the old car to do a full flip well and we would just see an empty

34
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,460
background a white or a gray background and not a new card as a background.

35
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,700
Therefore the second half of the Flip has to be done on the new component.

36
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,750
Therefore here for flip in which we'll add new one.

37
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,660
We we have to start at this point where the first one stops.

38
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:02,530
So at 90 degrees and we when one to transform all the way down to zero degrees again so that the new

39
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:08,130
component which gets added in is now rotated fully talked you.

40
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,250
I hope that makes sense.

41
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,370
Rotate your old one out until it is exactly at 90 degrees so almost invisible so to say.

42
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:20,450
And then if you would leave it to continue to 1 had an 80 percent we would see the back side of it which

43
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,560
says some default gray color.

44
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,870
Therefore the back side should be the new component.

45
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:31,430
Which is why this takes over at 90 degrees well with that animation set up here.

46
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,780
Let's see what do we need to set here.

47
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:40,320
Well flip enter this should be transform

48
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,570
rotate.

49
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,470
Why not.

50
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:50,410
Zero degrees though we shouldn't need that because that is the starting state here and from there we

51
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,030
could remove the whole flip entry class I'm just leaving it here so that again you see all the classes

52
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,000
you could use flip ENTRAR act active year desires.

53
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:07,510
While Steve Phlip in any mation place well this shell used the flip in any mation over let's say half

54
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:12,210
a second of course choose any timeframe of your choice or your preference.

55
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:18,430
I want to use the ease out easing function and forwards to stay in the final place and not snap back

56
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,850
to the initial from state.

57
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,740
Now for Flip leaf we also want to transform rotate.

58
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:30,690
Why 0 degrees shouldn't be needed too though.

59
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,110
So let's Calment this out too and flip leave active Well here I want to have my animation where I want

60
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,360
to play flip out over half a second.

61
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:45,730
Ease out and forwards as well just like for Flip interactive Of course you could group them together.

62
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,290
But I want to be explicit here.

63
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,200
Now with that set up let's see this in the running application if I reload.

64
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:58,640
That should be minus two it almost works but we don't see the flip.

65
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,570
Our We only see it then flipped in.

66
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:06,410
But what's happening to the average part of the animation Well what's happening is that this should

67
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,780
be called flip out here.

68
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,930
So let's reload it again and try this again.

69
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,270
Now it looks how it should look like.

70
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:19,950
And if they get the wrong answer like this one I get a warning and the right one flips it.

71
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,580
So I know that it's a small practice about animations.

72
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:29,560
Now you could continue practicing by adding more animations here or it for example go back to the monster

73
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,120
slay application.

74
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:39,070
And on that try to make a list of the dialogue we use there to lock the player actions and so on.

75
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,060
That could be animated with transition group.

76
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,280
That would be a nice practice in the next lecture.

77
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:51,890
You will see my updated Monster Slayer code where I added these animations to that application for the

78
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,200
group specifically.

79
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,090
And then you can compare this because this really is what I want to encourage you to do.

80
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:04,180
Challenge my code and challenge yourself and use the things you learn here especially about animations

81
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,490
for example and practice it in existing applications to try to.

82
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,460
Any made certain things and play around with it with debt.

83
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,340
We achieved a lot.

84
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,630
We learned a lot of the basics in this animation.

85
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,690
We're all the way in the future.

86
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,310
Yes we're old already.

87
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,640
Now a one to move on to how we can leave the future.

88
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:29,390
Yes app for a moment and reach out to some server if we need to fetch or store some data something we

89
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,340
haven't had a look at yet.

90
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,960
So there we will have a look at how we can use HTP in our view Chia's application.

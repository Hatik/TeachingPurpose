1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,910
Finally consider the falling use case.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,030
Do you know any made C S S.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,470
This is a nice little library of animations you can use.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:17,650
So here you basically get some animations you can use out of the box by simply attaching some C S S

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,190
classes to your elements.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:25,590
And if we did get her page you can see a detailed Well explanation on how it works.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,830
So I want to use it here are grappling from the CD end here and then go into my next Chimo Felber or

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:38,280
want to attach it in my head here like it is.

9
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:45,240
So now I got my CDN include import here attached and then if we have a look we can see that we can use

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,310
any animation from this package by adding the enemy class and then a name of the animation we want to

11
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,860
use to an element.

12
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,050
Now I want to use such animation when adding element.

13
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:01,980
The problem we have of course is let's say I went to any made this newly added transition here which

14
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,390
initially appears the problem we have is whatever name we specify here.

15
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,960
View chess will always use this name and then we enter interactive and so on classes.

16
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,100
Now for this package just will not work because we need to add any meat to the class.

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,020
And then let's say the bounds class if we wanted to use that.

18
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:27,930
So how could we tell VTES to use different classes than the ones it uses by default.

19
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,700
Well with some extra attributes you can set up on the transition element here.

20
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:38,910
I'll show you which ones on this transition element we already set up name end up here but we couldn't

21
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,680
configure it even more.

22
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,220
We can override the default classes.

23
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,790
VTES attaches.

24
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:51,180
So if we set up name like Faid here it would add Faid entrance so on but we don't have to use these

25
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,240
classes.

26
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:57,910
Instead I can remove name here and explicitly tell V-chips which class to attach.

27
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,510
At which point of time.

28
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,700
So we can tell it deep.

29
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:08,460
Enter class here by adding this attribute we could say well the default is always the enter or if we

30
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,730
set up a name our name entered.

31
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,730
We could at end any class we want to attach here.

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,480
Now I don't want to attach a clause here because I don't need you.

33
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,070
I'm interested in the enter active clause.

34
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,570
So I want to overwrite this.

35
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,580
And here I want to attach the animated class.

36
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,350
This is the one I always need to attach to play animation with this framework or this library.

37
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,380
And then you don't want to use the bounce animation.

38
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:36,770
So I will also add bouncier and this should already be enough to any made in with disbalance animation.

39
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,880
Now we can also override of course the leaf class.

40
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:46,500
I don't need a specific class here which is set for this one frame but I do need a specific class for

41
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,270
the active case so when it is playing the animation here I want it to.

42
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,770
Well let's pick a different one maybe not balance let's say here we want to use shake.

43
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,870
So I will add shake here.

44
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,450
Now that I'm telling you just don't use your default don't use vi enter the entry of class.

45
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,900
Don't use my name active with my name ective interact with class and so on.

46
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,870
Instead use these classes here at these points of time.

47
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,880
Now for these empty classes here we need to remove them.

48
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,190
Otherwise we will get an error.

49
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,190
Because V-chips would try to attach something which isn't there.

50
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:26,310
I just wanted to show you that you have all these four configuration items at your hand but of course

51
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,180
you don't need to use them.

52
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,460
And if you don't use them don't set them up to be empty here.

53
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:37,290
So if this change lets view or an application by reloading and there you see it's playing the animation

54
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,050
we wanted it to play jumping and bouncing around.

55
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,740
One thing to keep in mind here though is it looks like when setting up your own classes here a year

56
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:53,780
does not work with them so that looks like it only works when used with the default way or the default

57
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,600
classes.

58
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:59,230
Maybe something which will get fixed but didn't work at the point of time I recorded this video though.

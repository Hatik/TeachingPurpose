1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:09,330
Let's start with the basics with simple transition consider this case we have an element which currently

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,660
is not attached to the doll.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:18,570
Let's say some div and we use the IV or V show to trigger or to check some condition whether it is should

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,840
be attached to that on.

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,020
Now the condition becomes true resolves to true so the elements should be attached.

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,300
And right now we used to if we show that instantly it hatched it or instantly removed it.

7
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,440
Well we could and also any mates the attaching to the DOM.

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,950
And then it would also be nice if you could animate d remove from the DOM.

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,560
So once we click the button again let's say so that in the end state we still don't have the element

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:43,990
maybe.

11
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,320
But we estimate that both the appearance and the removal.

12
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:55,590
Well we can do this with a specific element or component a wrapper view chess offers us this transitional

13
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,010
element.

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,140
So let's have a closer look at this in the next video.

1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,530
I'm in a new project which looks like there's a browser at the beginning and then the project itself

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,760
it's basically the APTA view fall which is pretty empty just get the bootstrap container row and column

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,830
set up here and an empty object which doesn't return any data yet.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,800
And well all the other files are pretty empty as well.

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,640
Just import it would strip here and the next to each team will follow.

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,300
So this is what I'll start with.

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:31,380
And the goal now is to showed this simple case of adding an element to the DOM we learnt before and

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,420
then animating it.

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:39,270
So let's add an element first we'll add a new let's say horizontal line here first and thereafter I

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,270
want to have a button with closet's button and Button primary to give it some styling where we can say

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,400
show alert.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,660
And I want to show such a brooch Driveller it's so using this see as class bootstrap framework offers

13
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,170
me which is alert.

14
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,740
And then let's say to enfold like this deserves some info.

15
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,670
Now if we have a look at this the application it doesn't say what it will look like if it's always attached

16
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,430
something a bit too close to the button for my tastes.

17
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,210
Let me add some other line breaks here.

18
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,630
So that is what it should look like.

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,440
Now I want to show to learn Additionally and we learned how to do that in order to show it conditionally.

20
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,760
I will add a new property named show and also the two falls initially to not show it.

21
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,830
And then on this alert Div I will simply add Vi if I could also use the show that is also animate table

22
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,890
as you will learn so it will use the IF here.

23
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,050
And then I will check.

24
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:36,570
Show and on this button therefore I will set a click listener or add a click listener where I simply

25
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,780
said show to what it currently is not.

26
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,250
So to toggle it if it's true it will be set to false and the other way around.

27
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:49,440
Now if we save this and have a look at this application we can now show the old order like this does

28
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,040
this nice.

29
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,060
This is what you learned before and this is not animated.

30
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,790
So we should change this.

31
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:02,250
And as I showed you on the slides before it we can change this by simply wrapping this div in this transition

32
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,830
component here V-chips offices.

33
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:13,290
This is a special component which we can use to animate anything which is between the opening and closing

34
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:13,820
tag.

35
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,190
Important here.

36
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,840
You can only animate one element with transition.

37
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,370
Now you can have multiple elements inside of this transition component like this.

38
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,560
But then the conditions of these elements have to alternate.

39
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,940
You cannot animate a list in there let's say you cannot.

40
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:38,370
Any made that the addition or deletion of list items you can have multiple elements in here to transition

41
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,500
between them but you can only show one at a time.

42
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,460
So doing this year will instantly give me an error in the console.

43
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,170
As you can see because we only may use it for a single element and should we use another element we

44
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,060
will learn about later.

45
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,640
You'll see it here later.

46
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,340
So let me remove this.

47
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:05,750
Now as you could see if I put it or if I was one element this is shown but it's still not animate yet.

48
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,920
So how do we animated with this transition element.

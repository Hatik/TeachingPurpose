00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,930
This a project we're going to bolt and this module.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,830
It's not super complicated but it does use animations.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,660
It does use components.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,550
We get this super quiz where we have to answer some questions or some mathematical questions some additional

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,830
questions that are difficult to be honest.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:24,700
But then here for example we say you should be 100 and we have this nice animation showing once we answer.

7
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:30,640
So here we are using what we learned for some things of what you learned before with that animation

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,280
at least.

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:37,090
And that should allow you to build upon this and dive deeper into that and challenge you even more regarding

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,280
animations.

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,650
So this would be a good starting point.

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:49,630
Try building this application with maybe dynamic components for this part here where we are able to

13
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:59,930
answer this and switch our question and some animations in there in the next what do you all start building

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:07,160
as myself and walk you through my solution which you make use as a corporation or of course as always

15
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,810
challenge it try to improve it try to find different ways to achieve the same See you in the video.

1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,770
We saw C S S transition properties and action and CSSA animations.

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,250
Now let's mix both.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:15,540
I want to adjust my sliding animation here such that it not only slides up and down but that it is also

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,720
becoming transparent or is transparent at the beginning.

5
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,230
Now it does.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,060
I will first adjust my slide entry class here.

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,840
Hearable have the initial opacity of zero.

8
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:35,680
And on Slide the entry actif I therefore also want you to have a transition where I set the pace over

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,730
let's say half a second.

10
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:44,300
And yes of course you could animate your Pasotti year in your keyframes as well.

11
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:50,060
I just want to show you how to mix transition and animation here because sometimes you need it or you

12
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,920
want that behavior.

13
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:57,350
Now for slide leaf I don't need to set up anything because we don't need to set the opacity their default

14
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,830
opacity of 1 is exactly what you want.

15
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:07,870
But here I want to add a transition up on leaving it or up on these leaf act of class being attached

16
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,790
and here I want to animate the opacity over one second let's say.

17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,950
And of course also set your pace to zero here.

18
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:25,070
Now if I really don't reload this let's see I'd say this looks much better now though we do have a problem

19
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:25,310
here.

20
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:33,680
Now if we have a look at this bread now we're animating here over one second when we animated in and

21
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,830
we transitional we're one second if we animated out.

22
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:44,480
Now the issue we do have is if I were to set the transition of the copasetic you freeze seconds upon

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,350
removing it

24
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:59,630
and I reload this well to us it looks a bit strange here doesn't it now because now a chump's the reason

25
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:08,060
here of course is that normally we would want this animation to end once it slides down and maybe it

26
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:14,390
is not fully transparent by this point of time but it certainly looks ugly if it uses the transition.

27
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:19,940
Now the problem is since we have both animation and transition here beauteous doesn't know which one

28
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,510
to use.

29
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,870
We have two different operations here and it takes too long to one.

30
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:31,790
Now we can't tell you chairs which duration of which property to use by adding a type property here

31
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:38,540
to the transition component and then setting type ever to animation or to transition because these are

32
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,480
DID HE WAS us as properties we can use to animate things.

33
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,050
And with that we can set up which one to use.

34
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:51,950
So I could set those to animation and this will make sure that for future as the animation finishes

35
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:57,950
the transition I should say here finishes but both names are occupied so that this removing of the element

36
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:04,280
is done once the animation here finishes and not once the transition finishes because I said this to

37
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,690
type animation.

38
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:10,070
We can see this if I were lotas animated in and now remove it.

39
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:14,780
We see we don't have that ugly champ because even though the transitional was finished it took three

40
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,600
seconds.

41
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,870
The animation you see is as property animation was finished and that is then when you chairs nose.

42
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,910
Ok I'm done.

43
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,750
Remove it.

44
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,920
So this is important.

45
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:29,020
If you mix animation and transition make sure to set up which one dictates the length.

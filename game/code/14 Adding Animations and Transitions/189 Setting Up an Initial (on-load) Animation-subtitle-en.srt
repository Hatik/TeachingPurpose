1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:06,310
So will learn the basics about animating our eloquence here.

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:12,960
Now let me read a bit deeper into what as we can configure to really fine tune these to our needs.

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:17,350
I'm going to copy this transition up here and copy it.

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,280
And here we all use the F again because that's the more often use case.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,130
And now let's say I in general he said show too true.

6
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:32,920
Now if I do this of course and a lot as we see all three elements now maybe we want to.

7
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:39,910
Any made this element when the page is loaded first because all the elements could also transition smoothly

8
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,550
in such a case right.

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:47,410
If you wisit this page you probably want to animate some element to really give the user the impression

10
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,540
of hey I landed on this page.

11
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,130
Well I'll demonstrate this with this first element here.

12
00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:00,240
To tell future has to also animate the initial attaching to the dawn.

13
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:05,670
You can add the appear attribute to the transition component here to this wrapper.

14
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:12,670
By doing so if I reload this you see again this move fully animates in down there.

15
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,040
And that is exactly the behavior we want here.

16
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:20,320
You wanted to animate and because you want to alter any made this initial attachment to the dorm and

17
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,470
not only the one if by trigger this button here and hence you get the well-behaved we already know but

18
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,140
also the initial loading.

Welcome to your neighbor module.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:10,520
So we learn about components about forums about the general templates and the core features of view

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,530
future.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,660
We also learned about directives folders and mix and so we learned about a lot of things.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:23,270
A lot of things which are really important to view chairs and really our core features now would also

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,600
be nice to make our application a little bit prettier.

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:33,230
And for making it prettier and telling the user what he just did or where he is at and your application

8
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,960
animations are key animations are more than just an extra benefit.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,770
Animations really allow your user to know to understand how to use your application and where in which

10
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,570
point of the application the user currently is.

11
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:55,220
Therefore in this module we'll have a look at animations and transitions how we can animate single objects

12
00:00:55,310 --> 00:01:02,900
animated transition off to objects and animate whole list of items like sliding you items in and sliding

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,970
old items out or stuff like that.

14
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,070
So let's dive in.

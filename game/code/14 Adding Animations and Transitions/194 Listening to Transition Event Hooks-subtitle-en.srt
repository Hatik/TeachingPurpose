1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,000
Thus far be you.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,040
S. s. s. s. s. s. transition's and animations to animate our elements in and out and to animate the

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,010
transition between two elements.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:16,300
We can also use Chavez script because with a script we can of course also influenced the style position

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,270
and much more of such element or anything we want basically.

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,310
Now chess allows us to also listen to certain events.

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:29,740
This transition element this transition element view chair shifts with Emmets.

8
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:36,160
So there's a transition component we wrap our elements in at some events at certain points of time and

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,170
we can listen to these events to execute our own Chavez script code.

10
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,650
Now the missing piece is to know which events are emitted at which point of time.

11
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,040
And here we see a similar pattern as with DC s s classes.

12
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:57,070
We add our element and then we remove it and upon adding We first have to before enter hook.

13
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:03,130
This is kind of comparable to D and C S S class being attached for one frame.

14
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:09,400
Then right after we get the enter hook this is where we would then typically play our animation then

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,680
we have offerer enter.

16
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:17,740
Does this new Endace executed once the animation finished and port note you can combine all that with

17
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,420
Roscius as classes.

18
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:25,660
You can also expect some abro code in each of these hooks so that it's perfectly possible and we have

19
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:31,690
the after entry cancell took which is called whenever we kind of say Ill change the condition which

20
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,320
would add to the element before the animation finished.

21
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:40,750
Well and that year we get the same hooks for leaving it or for moving and I'll pick up the four leaf

22
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,080
leave after leaf and after leaf cancel.

23
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,250
These are the hooks we've got a whaleboat.

24
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:52,090
As I said you can mix them with C S S they get executed any ways you can change the style of the element

25
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,840
here or do something completely different or nothing at all like we did before.

26
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:03,980
But now let's have a look at how we can use these hooks to play a nice animation purely for chala script.

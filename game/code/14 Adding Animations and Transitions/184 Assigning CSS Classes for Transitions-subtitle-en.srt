1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:07,550
So we want to use this new knowledge that your chest somehow attaches some seats as classes with our

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:08,500
alert here.

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,780
So back in the application how do we do that.

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:19,380
Well we could use the transition like that and simply set up some styles with classes named VI.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,600
Enter the interactive and so on because that would be the default.

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,160
But typically oftentimes you override that.

7
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:33,020
So let's say I hear one unfaded and therefore I get the name attribute here.

8
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:38,870
Now no colon at the beginning because I don't want to dynamically bind this to some property in which

9
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:44,870
case I would need a colon but I want to hard code the name into here as a string so I can simply give

10
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,190
it a name here and I'll name it fate.

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,980
What this means is that Fujairah will now attach fate.

12
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:56,570
Enter fate an act of fate leave and fate leave active to this element whenever needed.

13
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,270
So during the animation in order to get information out.

14
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:06,080
So adding and removing the element that means I can now set these classes updown their fate enter would

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,220
be the one which is attached for one frame at the beginning fate and re-active is the one which is attached

16
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,790
for the whole at each element in any mation time.

17
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,800
And then we all have of course Faid leave and fate leave active.

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:28,250
Now the important thing and that is really important to keep in mind is that view Chasa will analyze

19
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:34,160
this see s s code will have a look at it and therefore determine how long the animation runs.

20
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:40,900
Right now it would see that the animation well doesn't run at all which is why it instantly attaches

21
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:49,120
and detach it it will automatically prolong this and give you the chance to really execute your ACARS

22
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,360
code here.

23
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,140
Once you do start adding things here which takes some time.

24
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,090
Now what things would that be.

25
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:02,540
Typically the transmission property where you animated transitional of some C S S properties or DC s

26
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:07,540
s animation property where you set up a specific animation configured with keyframes.

27
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,830
No I'm not going to dive deep into transition and animation here because that is a really core C S S

28
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:18,710
stuff though of course you will see it being used by me in the next three years where we will now set

29
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,370
up such check sample application.

30
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,030
Actually let's start with such animation.

31
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,810
40 fading in the next video.

1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:07,450
Now that we are taking or Witch-Hollow stript time to execute some code so that we can actually see

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:13,960
animation now the place to animate is enter into leaf function because these are the functions which

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,480
get executed after the initial states have been settled before enter and before leave.

4
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,380
And well before we're done.

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:28,100
So here in Antar besides logging this I want to grow the width of this death.

6
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,780
So I want to grow it to the right make it a bit broader.

7
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,590
And upon leaving I want to make it smaller let's say these are the two animations I want to play for

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:45,850
now what I will do to play this is I will set up variable round here with the last keyword is 6 syntax

9
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,380
and then I'll set up intro.

10
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:55,270
Well said intro well because I want to grow it in steps of course and not instantly make it pop from

11
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,690
normal size to broader.

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,600
So here we do we need Central will to play or to change something over some time and I want to set it

13
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:11,380
in an interval of let's say 20 milliseconds so every 20 milliseconds I want to change this div now in

14
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:16,780
this function here and the first argument of set interval I execute the code at one a change every 20

15
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,740
seconds milliseconds.

16
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:25,690
So here I want to exit my excess my element there to style and then let's say the width and I want to

17
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,140
set you with two.

18
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:37,740
Now you want to deal with it right now has plus something which depends on the round we are currently

19
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,350
in.

20
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:48,260
So I want to bind the two element style with the curve with plus round times 10 let's say.

21
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:54,200
So in round one we add 10 pixels and round two we add 20 pixels and so on.

22
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,730
Now this will make it grow exponentially though because it would take the old width and then add ever

23
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,930
higher numbers to it.

24
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,140
So that's not really that's not what I want.

25
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:11,100
Instead I will save a new property which will name element with and I'll set it to 100 because I want

26
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,930
to have 100 pixels being the default.

27
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,400
This means I can now use this year this element the width.

28
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:25,740
And now I will make it grow from 100 to 110 from 100 to 120 because this will always stay constant It

29
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,720
never changes.

30
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,860
It's only the width which is attached attached here.

31
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,770
Just that year excuse me.

32
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,380
So let's put this into parentheses to execute this calculation first before we then convert it into

33
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,780
a string and add pixels.

34
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:45,490
And yet because we need to set it in pixels in the end and not as a number this shot changed to styling.

35
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:52,860
Then of course we also need to increase the round by one so that this round variable increases and we

36
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,570
want to set up an exit condition.

37
00:02:54,570 --> 00:03:01,020
So if round is greater than 20 if we execute it to 20 times let's say then I want to clear the entire

38
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,650
well with the clear integral method and passing the interval which is stored in a constant.

39
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,860
And I want to call down here and don't want to call it outside of that because that was what that is

40
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,500
what I was talking before about I don't want to execute or don't want to mark this as finished once

41
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,760
this code has been executed because we do have an asynchronous operation there.

42
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,920
Therefore Dangi all be executed once we really are done.

43
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,310
Once we reach this exit condition here now does this looks good.

44
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,650
But we should also set the initial with fear before entering.

45
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:37,620
So here we should set element with two 100.

46
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:45,300
We don't really change it but just to make sure that it really is 100 and then we want to set the element

47
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,320
style the with to this element.

48
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:55,230
With Plus pixels so that we reset it to 100 before adding it to a dog.

49
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:01,130
Because if we added up before and removed it this might have been in a different state especially if

50
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,090
we cancel some animation in between.

51
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,870
So therefore we want to make sure that we reset everything here before Andrew.

52
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:15,170
Well and with that set up we can of course also go to you before we leave down there but we also want

53
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,450
to configure it though here.

54
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:27,870
We definitely want to set the elements style with to save 300 pixels like this does us very little bit

55
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:36,430
in the end ofter our entire animation here because we animated up all the way to 20 pixels at you 20

56
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,580
times 10 plus 100 or so to 300 pixels.

57
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:46,320
Well and for animating it out I can simply copy the code from the ENTRAR function here override to done

58
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,930
function because you want to call this an our exit condition here too.

59
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:56,850
And the only thing I need to change here is that I want to of course decrease the width though this

60
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,550
element with will always be 100.

61
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:05,910
So for this to work we should also add something here and before I leave and set this element with to

62
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:14,290
300 and then we can also override this year to use this element with plus pixels here again.

63
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,520
So now it also makes sense to reset this to 100 and before enter.

64
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,350
Let's see if this works as it should.

65
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,350
We have a look at this.

66
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:31,630
Any application we can load that to grow it and then shrink it load it and get loaded and shrink it.

67
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:36,560
And you see if we loaded for the first time we get this ugly chump because then our initial With doesn't

68
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,210
fit the with it should have.

69
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:43,670
Once it is attached to the Dom and we can easily fix this by going to our code and set to work to free

70
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,800
hundreds here and now you see that looks pretty good.

71
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:53,000
Now we get the animations we wanted now all done through Javascript.

72
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:59,270
And just to highlight this once more you can mix javascript animations and see as animations.

73
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:05,510
Here I just wanted to show the world he did the extreme opposite by just using Chavez.

74
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,850
Mixing it is fine if you do use only javascript.

75
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:15,840
Consider using this C-s as attributes here though to tell you chess that it may skip DC s s detection.

1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:06,970
Now with the current state here we're not executing any information we're not executing any code besides

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,620
logging to the console.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:13,330
But you see that all these events get admitted and our hooks get cold.

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,060
Now before we start adding some challenge of code I want to highlight something.

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,140
We're not using CSSA right.

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:24,490
We're doing everything for javascript which is why we need to call the done function down there.

7
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:30,900
Now if we don't use VSS You might also tell you chess we don't get an error if we don't tell it.

8
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:37,180
But if we do tell it it can step skip the step of determining whether we do have a SEUS estimation attached

9
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:37,830
or not.

10
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:43,530
Because keep in mind if we don't have names set up that doesn't mean it doesn't look for Jesus classes

11
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,350
to attach.

12
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:50,290
It means it looks to attach a and Jervy interactive and so on and it will find that these classes don't

13
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:56,740
exist but we can skip this checking if we know well we won't attach ones because we don't want to use

14
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,560
them here.

15
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,630
So you can tell it by adding Kolins see us as false.

16
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:09,010
Now Colin CSSA instead of just c s s because we want to pass a boolean here and not pass false as a

17
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:09,760
string.

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,280
This is why we need to use attribute binding.

19
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,880
Now with falles being passed here this means don't look for X years as classes.

20
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,030
We don't use them.

21
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:24,610
So you may skip the step and you immediately execute these hooks here so that we can take your word

22
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:25,550
with javascript.

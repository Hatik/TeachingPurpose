1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,850
So we now want to use animation instead of transmission.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,670
Let's say we want to slide this in.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,180
We could also achieve a slide in effect with the transmission property but for demo purposes let's use

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,360
animation.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,260
I need to set up these slide entry class there for I haven't attached it up there yet but I will do

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,650
so in a second.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,670
Slide enter here we will have slide enter active and then we will also need slide leave.

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,170
And of course slide leef active.

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:37,610
So these are DCs ASC clauses which you could now use by setting up a name of slide here.

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,810
I'll leave it at fate for now though.

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,990
Now these classes don't do that much right now for any nations to be playable.

12
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:51,720
I also need to set up some key frames with key frames and I will have a slide in any nation and then

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,420
I'll slide out animation.

14
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,660
Now here you could specify the individual percentages.

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:04,850
I'm going to say from and to to keep it real simple and I want to start sliding it in with transforms

16
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:12,420
so when I move it in its position here with translate y on the y axis and then I want to move it by

17
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:20,930
20 pixels and 2 is where I want to end and I want to and a real position of the element hands translate

18
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:26,140
y Shelby set to Ciro which is the position the element really has the document flow.

19
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:33,290
Well and for that basically copy that forty's slide out animation sales slide out like this.

20
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:49,130
And then all in do here is moved is like that and then renamed us from into loops from 2 to also slide

21
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:54,620
it out on the y axis again so that we have a nice sliding animation of course set up any animation you

22
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,580
want.

23
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,470
Now with these tricky frames you're configured.

24
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,180
I can now set up these slide class up here.

25
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:09,380
Now on Slide enter I could set up transform and then translate Y and then 20 pixels because that is

26
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,490
our beginning stage here though as I do set it up as a key frame here.

27
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,340
I don't really need to set it up here again.

28
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,480
It wouldn't hurt but it also isn't needed.

29
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:23,700
So now special starting state again because we do set up the starting state here in the keyframes Since

30
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,770
will use the CSSA animation in slide interactive.

31
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:33,620
I now want to play this animation so the animation Shelby slide in referring to Diski frame here of

32
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,380
course.

33
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:41,470
Over one second let's say we have that ease out using function 2 and a bit slower than we start.

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,090
And importantly we need to set up forwards so that the element stays in the finishing position off this

35
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:53,380
animation and doesn't snap back to the start well and we're leaving here there.

36
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:59,870
I want to use no initial state because I no need to the starting position of the element is the default

37
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:06,320
position Alte element but I want to animation for the time where this active class is attached.

38
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:15,760
And here I want to slide it in excuse me I want to use slide out or one second with ease out again and

39
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,800
forwards to keep it down there.

40
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,830
And with that if we save this we can now go up here.

41
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,620
Copy that.

42
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:29,800
That they have in this transition now add a second one with the slide class and let's reload this and

43
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,070
showed us this slides up and slice down.

44
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,920
Now this all really looks great.

45
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:44,050
We see now we're using a C S S and you mation to use it or to animate this though it's a bit too bad

46
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:49,510
or I don't like that it instantly slides down and appears like that would be nicer if it would also

47
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,190
become transparent over the time period.

48
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,500
So in the next you let's see how we can mix transition and animation.

1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,150
Thus far we only had a look at how to any made single items.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:11,250
Yes we had transition between multiple items but in the end we only saw one element now in lists which

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,260
aren't that uncommon to be animated.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,660
You have multiple items at once or you might have different collections on your page where you want

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,860
to have multiple animations at once or model items which can be animated the ones at least.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,240
So we might have such a list and we want to animate the removal of that item as well as the addition

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,500
of a new item.

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:38,280
And we can do this with Transition Group which is another component or satchel wrapper you chase ships

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,800
with just like transition.

10
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,480
But now for multiple items.

1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,260
Well we've already achieved a lot here.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,810
We learn a lot about animations and transitions.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:12,660
Number four I come to animating groups of elements which you can do right now the best you can do is

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,720
switch between two or multiple elements but only one may be displayed at all times.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:24,420
So before we come to do a different component which allows us to animate different pieces or elements

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,570
no code at the same time.

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:33,840
Let me show you a different thing or a different part of chess which we may animate or which we may

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,890
transition.

9
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,850
We transition between different aged female elements right now.

10
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:45,000
But there's one thing we learned about in the component section which would be for purrfect to transition

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,810
between.

12
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,330
I'm not talking about components because we could use them like normal HTL elements here.

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,780
I'm talking about dynamic components so dynamic components would also make up for a great transition

14
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,560
task.

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,900
Now let's do this.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,450
For this I will first quickly add two new components.

17
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:10,480
Danger alert component and you might be able to guess what this will hold.

18
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:17,910
It will hold a time soup's a template where I will simply have a bootstrap class with alert and then

19
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,530
alert danger.

20
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,950
This is dangerous maybe.

21
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:30,880
In Juris and I don't need any script here because well I don't want to have any specific logic in there.

22
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:37,590
I only want to have the template to demonstrate this and I will also have my success alert.

23
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,160
Let's say success alert the view.

24
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,780
So here we would then have our template where we say this is successful like this.

25
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:55,470
Now I get two new components and I want to switch between them here by having a look at my dynamic components

26
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,710
to use dynamic components.

27
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:04,300
I first need to register them as components and I'll do those locally here in my view instance.

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:12,540
So I'll add my components key here to register both my danger alert which I need to import then and

29
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:16,690
my success alert which I'll also need to import.

30
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,040
So let me add these imports up here real quick.

31
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,540
So here we need to import the danger alert from the danger alert.

32
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,590
Does the file end down there.

33
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:35,160
We all want to import the success alert and that allows me to hook them up to my properties down there

34
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,180
into component's object.

35
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:42,190
Hearable have the danger alert and of course also the success alert.

36
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,030
Now both components are available.

37
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:52,530
I will add a new property here to my data object which is de-selected component and by default that

38
00:02:52,530 --> 00:03:00,110
Shelby let me also change these names to be app dange or.

39
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:06,040
Now that I think about it that would be more in line to also have this app prefix.

40
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,830
So here de-select de-selected component shall be ab success alert with dashes in between.

41
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,780
Because again this is what new chess enables us to use when setting up our property names like this

42
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,260
down there.

43
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:25,090
So now this is the default selected component for my dynamic component added to component keyword and

44
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:31,300
then with Colon is dynamically bound to selected component like that.

45
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,540
Now I also want to add a button which allows me to switch between both.

46
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:44,350
So hirable have my button with Button button primary and Hiro simply want to toss all my components.

47
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,910
Of course you could also use a drop down instead of a but I'm going to use it like this.

48
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,450
And here I simply want to have a click listener.

49
00:03:52,240 --> 00:04:02,760
Where I check if selected component equals AB success alert if that is the case then I want a set selected

50
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:10,600
component and now this is getting really long pole chess for days does danger alert overwise separate

51
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,860
with the colon here.

52
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:20,120
I want to set selected component equal to app success alert.

53
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,190
So it is just hogging between the two components.

54
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,960
I'm importing here now.

55
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,680
If I go to the application I can see this done here.

56
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,520
I can switch between both.

57
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:37,720
And I should maybe go to my success alert and change this to success to make it dream.

58
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,670
Also add a horizontal line but now it really looks great.

59
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,790
So this works.

60
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,160
Now I want to animate is not new animated.

61
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:54,040
I'll go back in my application and in here of course I wrap this in a transition element like we learned

62
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,910
before.

63
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,520
So here tips like this.

64
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:04,500
What I want to do though is I now want to transition my component our my dynamic component.

65
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:11,670
Now can you do this just by using name Faid for example again to use this fade animation or is set up.

66
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:19,290
And now if we load again we already see we get this working though we get this ugly champ again.

67
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:24,830
So to avoid this are against demotes to out in ask before.

68
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,440
And now we're able to use this just like we used to two divs before but now there's a dynamic component

69
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:35,870
and here of course we could have multiple dynamic components because it will ensure that only one is

70
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:41,480
loaded at a time and that's the only thing transition cares about not between how many elements you're

71
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,650
switching but that in the end you're only displaying one at a time.

72
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,670
Well we're going to leave this one at a time.

73
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:54,350
So in with the next release though where we will have a look at how we can animate lace or generally

74
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,530
groups of items.

1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:09,060
So as we see here what we want to build is a quiz where we get addition and subtraction tasks here and

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,940
one which we don't have to answer.

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,600
And if we're right we want to flip this page and show.

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,610
That's correct and give us the possibility to go to the next question and then if were wrong then I

5
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,590
simply want to show in alert here.

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,920
So we need two components at least a question and the answer.

7
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:33,190
And when you do animation we maybe want to switch between the components with our our animation our

8
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,810
transition here say.

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,840
And I think these are all things we learned how to do both.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,110
So let's start with it.

11
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,340
So I'm starting a brand new project here.

12
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,730
It's pretty empty.

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:48,340
I think God is my default bootstrap contrite container again there from the next team of all the import

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,290
of bootstrap.

15
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:54,640
And that really is all the instance here is totally empty no data has been entered yet.

16
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:59,630
Now I want to start by building up my main interface on this rude page here.

17
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:07,060
So in the first row I may want to have a title which I give to class text center to well centered a

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,740
text.

19
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,830
This is a bootstrap helper class where I say the Superquinn choose any name you want of course.

20
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:19,390
And then I want to have a div for a number row below there maybe at a horizontal line in between.

21
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,870
And in this row I don't want to have to question empty answer.

22
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,250
So here I want to use my dynamic component.

23
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:31,330
I can already insert component here but of course I need to create these components as well so that

24
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,410
I can set them dynamically.

25
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,380
Well I will do that.

26
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:43,710
So let me add the components subfolder here and in this folder I want to have my answer and view file.

27
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,130
And my question Does the view file for.

28
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:56,800
Well the question of course now these two files here shall be switched dynamically now to be able to

29
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,530
switch them I will already import these components.

30
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,740
I know the files are empty We're going to add this but I can already Edhi imports here because I know

31
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,550
I will fold.

32
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,800
I will fold these files so import the questions from components.

33
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:17,120
Question that view and I do also import the answer from the answer to you file.

34
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:23,930
This allows me to add my components here to them locally without question which points to question and

35
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,810
an answer which points to an answer like this.

36
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,400
And then in my data I want to set up a property which holds the currently loaded component because we

37
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,010
want to use dynamic components here with this component placeholder we could say there.

38
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,260
Let's say I want to set the mode which initially is.

39
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:47,770
QUESTION So did we see a question at first at the beginning and then I can't simply bind it here with

40
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,240
Colon is to bind this dynamically to mode and this will be no question or answer.

41
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,340
No that won't do it though because mode is questions are answered though the component has a selector

42
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:12,210
or app question or app answer so I can simply change this here in my mode property to app question let's

43
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:17,100
say and I'm loading the app question component here at the beginning.

44
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:22,880
Now as I said this is empty at the beginning because well I haven't added any code to question that

45
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,500
view but will do this next.

46
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,020
Now any question of you fall.

47
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,700
I'm going to copy in some prepared code Now this might look like a lot but I don't want to focus on

48
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,010
writing just javascript logic for digging here.

49
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,740
Feel free to dig into the code to learn more about it.

50
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,690
But I want to focus on adding this animation.

51
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,640
Therefore I will walk you through what I'll do here.

52
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:50,580
I do have this title which outputs some questions stored in some property and then I do have some buttons

53
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:58,290
here which are basically just executing on answer where we pass this strange argument to which I'll

54
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:58,770
come back.

55
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,370
And which then showed the answer.

56
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,070
So one of the four answers.

57
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:07,500
Of course I need to generate the answers and I don't want to have the same button which holds the correct

58
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,170
answer at the same position all the time.

59
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:15,950
This is why I passed the second argument or where I do have something else and just answer on my answers

60
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,480
which seem to be stored in the array correct.

61
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,850
So this determines if this answer is correct or not.

62
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,210
So did any button here may hold the correct or false answer.

63
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:30,710
And we determined that upon clicking because it gets passed here to the array as to the method on answer.

64
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,550
So let's have a look and the answer arrayed there for that button.

65
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,330
Data array to be precise.

66
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:42,750
And there we do have a couple of objects which either each have to answer set to initially to zero.

67
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,640
That will change of course and then whether it's correct or true.

68
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,730
This will also change.

69
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:56,340
Now these are my button data fields or any button data objects and then in methods I get together generate

70
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,990
question method here.

71
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:03,530
Now generate questioners called here in the created lifecycle look so whenever this component is loaded

72
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:11,070
and in this method here which is quite long what I do is I generate a first and a second number because

73
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,170
you want to add or subtract subtract them.

74
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,260
Then I generate which mode you want to use.

75
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,370
That is a random number between 1 and 2.

76
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,750
Generate random numbers as a side note is a helper method here which I wrote to give me a random number

77
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:33,000
between the minimum and maximum border and then maybe also exclude some numbers from getting generated

78
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,210
that will become important when generating the answers.

79
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,970
So here I do generated these three random numbers the first and the second number for the addition or

80
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:48,430
subtraction and then the mode subtract or add and then the correct answer is set to 0 initially.

81
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,350
I then switch between the mode and mode.

82
00:05:51,390 --> 00:06:01,180
Addition is just one whereas mode substraction just it's just a global constant to use your and if mode

83
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:07,610
number a random number between 1 and 2 is one that is what's stored in motivation in the end.

84
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:15,000
Then we well set the correct answer to first number plus second number and we set the question to what's

85
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,710
first number plus second number using literal here string literal.

86
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:26,570
That's a E6 feature which allows me to output our property or variable like this inside of a string.

87
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,390
So say 6 feature.

88
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:33,360
And then I break of course and in subtraction I do the same but with a minus sign in between because

89
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,690
now we're subtracting and the default is that we get an error because well if we do get anything else

90
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:44,290
than one or two something failed horribly costis generate method should only give us one or two.

91
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,740
Well that's the determining of the mode and off the correct answer.

92
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:57,450
And then we need to generate some fake fake answers so I make sure that for all the four buttons I do

93
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:07,440
set some values the value on the first button is the correct answer minus 10 and then the correct answer

94
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,100
plus 10.

95
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,470
So these are the minimum or maximum borders for the generate number function.

96
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,340
But I never want to set the correct answer itself.

97
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:21,240
So I populate all four buttons with wrong answers which is why I said the correct property to false

98
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:30,330
for all four buttons here initially I need to accept or I need to exclude I should say this is the correct

99
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,800
answer here from the random number generation.

100
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,820
Because otherwise I might have two buttons with the same answer.

101
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:41,470
But one of them gives me that is wrong which would not be the desart behavior.

102
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:49,470
So all buttons are initially set to two wrong answers and then you're on the correct button I see where

103
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:56,170
I generate the correct button so I generate a random number between 0 and free because I have four elements

104
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:01,980
in the button data array which holds my buttons or the data 14 buttons and then a generator and the

105
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:07,530
number to determine which button should now get the correct answer 0 to free because the first button

106
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:12,310
has the index of zero and the last button has the index of three because we have four buttons again.

107
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,150
And then I simply generate which button should hold the correct data.

108
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,810
And then I set to correct data on that button.

109
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,340
So on this button that would be precise.

110
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,200
This is how I populate my buttons with wrong and right answers or data.

111
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:35,400
And then finally I do have this on Anzur method which gets executed in the on ends or afraid I get is

112
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,790
correct passed which is stored in the button data object.

113
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,540
Keep that in mind.

114
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,490
Correct as past is stored here.

115
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:49,050
And they do pass have been calling on answer and I simply admit an event here answered where I also

116
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,760
admit WEBER This is correct or not.

117
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,310
Now this is all I do here is a lot of code.

118
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,770
Most of the code is for the number generation which is why I didn't want to show it in detail here.

119
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,850
I hope it was still understandable.

120
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,980
Otherwise feel free to answer any quick question in a section of course.

121
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,530
And with that let's move onto the answer that you file and also populate that here.

122
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,740
I'm also going to copy in some prepared code.

123
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,080
And of course you will find all the code attached to this lecture.

124
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,920
And here I basically say that's correct because I always showed as if it's correct otherwise I showed

125
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,010
us alert.

126
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,560
And if we then click on next question I admit an event called confirmed.

127
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,870
So I have it disconfirmed event here.

128
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,020
And any question that view I M-80 answered event.

129
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,320
So now to jump in or after you fall is to listen to both events.

130
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:48,630
Wherever answer was picked or was given or if we offered giving a correct answer clicked on next question

131
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,000
hence here I will add two event listeners at answered.

132
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,970
This is my answer custom event emitted from the question that you file.

133
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:06,260
And here I want to execute answered and pass on the event data stored in these specific dollar sign

134
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,920
event property or variable I should say treated by you chaps.

135
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:14,140
And keep in mind this comes from the question property here.

136
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,420
Question component excuse me and here I pass.

137
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:22,650
If this is correct or not and this is specifically what I want to store here in dollar sign event.

138
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:28,340
Now if every component is loaded then I need to add the answer component.

139
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:33,640
I need to listen to confirmed so that the answer was confirmed them we want to see the next question.

140
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,330
And then I simply switched the mode to app question again.

141
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:43,680
Right now we don't have a place to switch it to answer or come to this but here we definitely switch

142
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,780
it back.

143
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:51,340
Now the place to switch it to app answer of course is in the methods object here.

144
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,320
All right this to Gabr here.

145
00:10:53,330 --> 00:11:00,110
I do have my answered method I want to execute up here and a pass is correct here as an argument which

146
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:07,390
gets passed from this loaded component from the questioned view file and here a check if it's correct

147
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,700
if this is true.

148
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,590
Well then I want to set this mode to app answer.

149
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,600
So I want to load my answer component.

150
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,400
But if it is it's not correct.

151
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,500
So in the L's case here.

152
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,180
Well then I want to set this most definitely to app question it should be in that mode already.

153
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,880
But just to make sure or to ensure it.

154
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,970
And I want to show wrong.

155
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,260
Try again as the alert here.

156
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,680
Really simple.

157
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,560
Well and this is all the initial set up it should need.

158
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,960
If I save this my server is already running an alert this we see it here and let's see.

159
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,250
That should be this result we see.

160
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,420
That's correct.

161
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:59,550
And we can now switch between that the missing piece of course is that we animate this and this is what

162
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,830
we'll do together in the next Electra's.

1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,830
In this module we had a detailed look at animations.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:11,970
We learned how to make the change of one single element the transition between multiple elements or

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:17,760
how to any made a whole list of elements where for example add and delete items or move items within

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,980
the list.

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:26,280
You also learned how to do that or how to add this in a real application and which different options

6
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,490
you have for animating for example using CSSA classes custom class names.

7
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,730
Pure javascript to which events you may Eleison and so on.

8
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:42,150
With that you should have a basic toolset to play around with it and add animations to your application.

9
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:49,200
Try out some things and see what you can animate how that works which C-s as set up you need to make

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,380
it work any the way you want to make it work and so on.

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,740
With that let's move on and keep animations in mind for the rest of this course.

12
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,000
I will use them again in later sections too.

1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:09,260
Know thus far we only have to look at the case that we have the element we animated in and then we want

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,990
to remove this element like this.

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,350
Now this is only one use case.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:21,560
Oftentimes you also want to switch or switch between two elements so that as soon as the one element

5
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,270
is removed you start intimating in another one.

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,410
This would be a typical use case and now I want to show you how to set up such a transition from one

7
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:31,920
element to another one.

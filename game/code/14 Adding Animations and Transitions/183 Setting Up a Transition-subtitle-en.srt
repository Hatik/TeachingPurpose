1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:08,680
Well one of the typical cases you would use transition is transition component with what be you at Hache

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,850
see s as classes.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,580
You chest asked us for you I will show you how to tailor it better what it will then basically do is

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:23,400
it will determine when you for example use V.F. when it should attach element and that will at least

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:30,340
two classes as classes for animating it in and animating it out and by styling these classes you can

6
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,500
therefore set up an animation.

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,160
How does this look in the actual application.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,540
Well we animate an element.

9
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:45,710
And once you Chesterton's that should be attached to the conditional before the show becomes true.

10
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:52,390
And that is important to realize I guess you use it and we show to animate in such element we will learn

11
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:56,500
about other ways dynamic components for example later.

12
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:02,200
But typically if and we show what tools we have to decide that element should only conditionally be

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,290
attached to the dawn.

14
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,230
This is where transition will work fine with it.

15
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:13,480
You can use transition if you add an element let's say for your javascript code by appending a newly

16
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,090
created element or something like that.

17
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,720
You have to have this in your template already with.

18
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,670
Again the if the show ends on our tools you learn later.

19
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,810
So back to this UTSA attacked.

20
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,150
OK.

21
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:30,250
I have the F on element which is wrapped in a transition I should animated in what does.

22
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,690
You just do it first attaches as yes ask class which has a name.

23
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,080
You can set up indicated by the star here and then enter.

24
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,870
So for example you could say I want to name my animation fate.

25
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:49,030
Then you chaps would add a fait ENTRAR animation class excuse me C S S Class 2 this element only for

26
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,850
one frame at the beginning of this animation duration.

27
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,250
This is important.

28
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,960
This is the initial state.

29
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,050
So if you want to for example fade an element this would be the place where you set your pace to zero

30
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:09,130
so that it is not visible that it is fully transparent offered as one frame the enter act of class appended

31
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,060
to your class name so Faid interactive for example will be attached.

32
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,020
And this will be attached until the animation finishes.

33
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,730
The length of the animation will be determined by Chares automatically by the length of the transitions

34
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,090
were animations you set up and you're seeing as code.

35
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:29,890
So your chest does sniff your C S S code and have a look at it to determine how long these these classes

36
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,010
should be unhedged pretty clever.

37
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,780
Now once the elements in DS.

38
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,440
This class is also removed.

39
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,350
You will have a chance to set up any transitions and the final state in this interactive class.

40
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,060
And if you remove it it's pretty much the same.

41
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,770
Here we had first the teched the your name Lifeclass and then for the whole duration.

42
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:55,590
Did your name Leave Act of class and default if you don't enter a name is the answer.

43
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,590
So you can always use that.

44
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,280
Now that's the theory to make it really clear and to make it easier to understand.

45
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,680
Let's now use it in our application and set up a nice supplicated and and animation.

1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:07,480
So I will add a new horizontal line because we're now leaving DC s s world though of course we could

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:07,920
mix that.

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,950
I'm just emphasizing this because that is perfectly fine.

4
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:17,760
Maybe you want to play the animation freesias s and only listen to the end of it in the after enter

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,060
hook.

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,740
We just saw and execute some Charvis code once the animation finishes.

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:27,100
That's perfectly fine and not that uncommon but here I want to use all these hooks to really play the

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,200
whole animation.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,970
So I get my horse on line here and I will add a new button with Button classes button and Button primary

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,670
to give it some nice styling.

11
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:42,760
And here I will load or remove the element just so that I don't trigger everything with this show thing

12
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,000
up there.

13
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:52,360
Now here I want to add a click listener and toggle a new property called load like before show and I

14
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,580
will simply add this new load property.

15
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:01,060
I will set show to false initially so that we don't see all the drives from before but that we can now

16
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:06,190
focus on this one here load which is the new one we will use for all the cellos Scripturally but things

17
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:11,340
here then I'll add two line breaks to just have some space here.

18
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:16,900
And then of course the transition component again which I just explained does have DS specific event

19
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,940
limits.

20
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:24,610
Now in their eyes still want to have a div but now lets set it up a bit differently lets give it our

21
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:35,290
own style here lets say with a width of 100 pixels and a height of 100 pixels and a background color

22
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,740
of light green.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,240
And if we save this and go to the application we should see this and read right now this doesn't work

24
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:50,480
because now I will also need to attach we to it and point is to load to conditionally.

25
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,170
Well at Hach were detected after reloading here.

26
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,320
Now this works but now we want to animate it.

27
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,860
Frood Shala script.

28
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,700
So we get our day off year which you can attach and detach.

29
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:07,460
Nothing spectacular here we did that before but now when I use javascript to do that now for that lets

30
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,910
see which hooks get executed.

31
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,440
We saw it on a slide.

32
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,370
We got a couple of events we can listen to the first one is with at as we do listen to all the events

33
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:25,960
before enter that this is a custom event emitted by this transition component Boucek ships with in the

34
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,970
quotation marks we specify which function or method we want to execute.

35
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,870
And we will execute a before entry method which of course it will have yet to create.

36
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:41,230
Then we get the enter Meffert or the entry event being emitted here.

37
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:47,390
Then we also got the after entry event which is executed once the animation finishes.

38
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,950
After enter and we get Enter canceled.

39
00:02:53,110 --> 00:03:00,740
Now I know I already said this but you can use all these hooks on the S S and you missions up here.

40
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:08,620
For example if you added to lets say the first one you're at d enter D after Enter event listener you

41
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,350
could execute some code once every whenever D.C.'s estimation finishes.

42
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,660
So that is perfectly valid and something you will probably also use from time to time because you want

43
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:22,430
to execute some Chalis code upon finishing some animation back to this year.

44
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,850
Now we get these enter hooks and we get the same for leaving.

45
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:35,020
So we get before four leaf year and I want to execute before I leave this method which of course all

46
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,240
to have to add that we get just delete the event being executed or emitted.

47
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,470
I should say that we get off to leave where I want to execute after I leave.

48
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:51,550
And finally we get leave canceled where I want to execute leave can select this.

49
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,710
So these are now all the event listeners being set up listening to all the events.

50
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:00,450
This transition component does emit from time to time during the animations.

51
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,220
And now lets add them.

52
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:09,780
So in my view instance I'll add my methods here and here I got four ENTRAR and then before ENTRAR we

53
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:15,120
actually do receive a certain argument.

54
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,080
The argument we get here is the element on which this animation is performed.

55
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,260
So we can use this element here.

56
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,940
I simply want to lock before enter here.

57
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,220
Sort of you can see that we reached this hook and then we get the enter method.

58
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,320
Now enter Meffert which is where the animation really plays.

59
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,400
Also gets the element we need this element of course to be able to really change it to work with it.

60
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:45,270
But this also gets another method the done where argument I should say the done argument here which

61
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,570
actually is a function we can execute like this.

62
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,420
Now why would we execute it.

63
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:58,080
Well first I will log entry here but now why would we execute done earlier than is needed to tell you

64
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,590
chess.

65
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:06,570
Once this animation finishes when using C S S animations Well it can determine this from the timing

66
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,850
we set up here on the transition already animation property.

67
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,150
But when using shallow script we have no such timing.

68
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:19,110
You could say well it should be finished whenever all the code and enter is executed but maybe you have

69
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,910
some asynchronous code there then this wouldn't work anymore because then it would be executed before

70
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,660
the asynchronous code finished.

71
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,380
So you need to call down to really tell you cheers when you are done.

72
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,260
You dont need to call done if you do use C-s as animations.

73
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,770
So if we were to use the Add entrail listener here hear an execute enter a year where we do have some

74
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:46,680
CSSA animations being used well and view task is still able to determine when this animation ends.

75
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:52,380
From your osiers esque code but if you don't have any C S S code set up as we do here.

76
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:58,040
Well then it's not able to do so therefore you need to tell it with the done function being executed.

77
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:06,110
Well once we are done we got the after entry method we execute up there and after ENTRAR also receives

78
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:06,820
the element.

79
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,480
All these hooks do that.

80
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:16,820
So hirable and so log off to enter to see that we reach that and then we get Enter cancelled of course.

81
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:23,170
Here we also get the element on which we cancel this animation and it will also execute and canceled

82
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:23,820
here.

83
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,790
Now these are all the asty element hooks.

84
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,730
Now let's add the hour once we get the four or leave of course all the with the element.

85
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:41,550
And here I want to cancel LOC before I leave like this thereafter we also got the leave hook.

86
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,610
And here again we get it done function because as with adding it we want to know what we're doing once

87
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,570
we're done leaving it or removing it I should say.

88
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,720
So here I will console log leave.

89
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,690
And then of course we get all also often leave being executed here.

90
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:02,170
I want to console mark after leave therefore.

91
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:13,400
And then I also get leave canceled where we also get the element and then we log leave cancelled like

92
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,540
this.

93
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,040
Now these are all the hooks which get executed.

94
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:23,540
And we should already be able to see all of that by simply saving this going to the application opening

95
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,250
up our console here.

96
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,630
Reloading this.

97
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,250
And now let's remove it.

98
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:35,460
We see before we leave and leave and we don't see after leave before I forget to call.

99
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,340
Done here in this leaf hook just was explaining it and then forgot it.

100
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,140
But the great thing is you now see that it is important.

101
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,480
So let's try this again.

102
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:48,380
Remove it now easy before leave leave and after leave.

103
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,860
And if I add it again.

104
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:56,140
The MCP before enter enter and after enter you can see the canceled hooks being called right now because

105
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,280
since all everything happens instantly I can't cancel it.

106
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,060
We'll come to business segment though.

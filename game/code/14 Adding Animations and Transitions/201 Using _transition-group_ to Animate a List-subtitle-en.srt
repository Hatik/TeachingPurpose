1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:10,230
The cool thing is you don't need to add any new C-s as classes to be able to use transition group.

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,400
It works just like transition.

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:18,140
So you can use the same skills as classes your name enter your name enter active and so on.

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,070
The same is true for javascript hooks.

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,730
That's exactly the same.

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:29,050
The only difference is the name of the component you are using here but that is only relevant for the

7
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:35,970
future as you use a just like transition wrapping the code you want to have in your transition group.

8
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:41,180
By the way that should not include the unordered lists since we don't want to animate that.

9
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,870
Let me remove this.

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,820
So just like this.

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,980
And now this of course is more than one element because a list item will be replicated.

12
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,570
So therefore we need such a transition group.

13
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,790
And now again usage is the same as for translation.

14
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,450
But behind the scenes it now also works for multiply dms.

15
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,100
So let's say we want to use our slide animation so name slide.

16
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:10,850
We always set up all the class we need year and with that being set up let's see if it now works out

17
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,130
of the box.

18
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,480
Nope the whole list is gone.

19
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,970
What happened here.

20
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:23,180
It's kind of similar to the problem we had before with transitioning between two elements which used

21
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,290
the same HDMI tech like they have here.

22
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:33,650
We had to key them to let us know which element is which and for transition group we always have two

23
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,660
key elements here.

24
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:42,410
Even if they were using a several separate tech name so here we need to add a key because otherwise

25
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,920
the future is not able to identify the individual items in the list.

26
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,760
However it needs to be able to identify them because when it animates them it allows.

27
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,210
It also needs to move the existing elements.

28
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,540
And for that it needs to be sure that it moves the right element and for Dad it needs a key because

29
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,950
it can't identify them.

30
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,640
Otherwise each element needs a unique ID.

31
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,480
So you can choose anything which is unique here.

32
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,280
I will bind key with the colon because it's dynamic binding.

33
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:18,290
I want to set up here to my number because each number is only part of desire once it's a perfectly

34
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,260
valid unique key.

35
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:26,810
Now with this and last if we reload this we see that the list is back and if I added we see we now move

36
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:34,430
smoothly and inmates in though the one ugly thing is also the case for removing it that everything champs.

37
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:39,060
So it snaps de-list to Gavron after the element is removed.

38
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:44,050
And if I add one it instantly jumps down forward to make room for a new element.

39
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,390
It would be nice if that moving of elements would all be any made so that we really have a smooth animation

40
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,620
going on here in our list.

41
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,690
Turns out we can animated.

42
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,170
That's a big difference between transition group and transition.

43
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,610
Yes we can use it the same way but it also has extra here.

44
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,920
It gives us access to a new S class.

45
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,540
Besides slide enter slide interactive and so on because we're using slide animation here the same would

46
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,910
be true for fade of course if you use that.

47
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:21,680
Besides these classes we also got slide move and this class is attached to any element which needs to

48
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:27,110
change its place for example because a new element was added and the element therefore needs to change

49
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:32,210
to place because it means move down or when deleting element it needs to move up.

50
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:38,030
And for this movement process this slide move class here is attached to allow us to animate this as

51
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,900
well.

52
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,920
How shall we animate this then.

53
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:48,110
Well we could simply say transition and then transition the change of the transformed property over

54
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:56,180
one second transform is this property we use year in the animation for example a wedge UK will use behind

55
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,560
the scenes for moving elements.

56
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,260
So does this not related to our keyframes here.

57
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:08,150
The chairs will always move elements behind the scenes by using transform translate Y or X whatever

58
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,110
is appropriate to make them move their position.

59
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:19,910
Now since you chaps will do that behind the scenes to change the position of element we can transition

60
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:26,500
this property to transform property to take advantage of this being used by chess to animate it.

61
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:33,860
So what I'm telling CSSA here is what ever did transform property is somehow changed and it is changed

62
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:39,390
when beauty as use translate X or trancelike why y whenever that happens.

63
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,570
Animated over one second.

64
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,930
And this is why we will see such animation.

65
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:51,170
However if I use it like this what you will notice is that if I reload this and add the item it moves

66
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:56,200
down perfectly looks great it looks exactly how we want it to behave.

67
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,510
But if a removal item we still have this snapping going on now why is that.

68
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,880
Why is it working for adding items but not for removing items.

69
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:15,260
The answer is because when we remove the item the old items which are sitting below the new items still

70
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:22,810
have their position in the document flow and that position will only change if the old item is removed.

71
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,850
And the fact that we want to estimate it doesn't change just because it can't be animated with translate.

72
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,600
Why if we would hurt the document flow with that kind of.

73
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:38,360
So we have to go to Slide leave act if we're just a class attached to the element which is removed during

74
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,110
the removal process.

75
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:47,630
And here we have to switch its position to absolute desk make sure that other elements may move above

76
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:54,980
this element was this element is still being animated and therefore if I now reload this we can see

77
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:04,400
I can add items but if we remove one this now looks fine and it moves the other items correctly just

78
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,630
like that.

79
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:10,560
So this looks much better now with the whole list being animated now.

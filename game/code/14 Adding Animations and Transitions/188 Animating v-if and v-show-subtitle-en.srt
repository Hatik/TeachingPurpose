00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,820
Thus far I showed all these animations using the F here.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:12,090
Now it's important to understand you can also use the show here and that will work just the same as

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,930
you will see if I reload.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,770
This also works though keep in mind of course the show still works as you know it will work.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:24,120
It doesn't remove or attach elements it only triggers the display property.

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,990
So you can also use animations with the show.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,880
The alternative is we have whatever you prefer.

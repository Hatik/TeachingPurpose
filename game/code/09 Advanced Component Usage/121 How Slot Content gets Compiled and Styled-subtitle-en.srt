1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,800
So this is how we can use a slot with this slot.

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:11,990
The key word here with the slot component kind of it's important to understand where de-code we're passing

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,970
in here is compiled though.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,280
So let's check is for example with the style.

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:26,240
If I set a style of styling my atch age one tag you're to have a red color and keep in mind we're passing

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,990
an age to tag actually.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,010
OK so let's stop H-2 Let's see.

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,110
Do you think this will change to styling.

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,210
It does.

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,750
So the styling of that component is used here.

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:45,690
So did shout components styling is applied to the data being passed in from outside.

12
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,610
That's the first key take away.

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:55,790
So if I remove this year and put it in the style next year of the parent so that I set the color red

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,600
there and set us all to scoped do I think it will now work too.

15
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,650
No.

16
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,830
So that's the key takeaway as I said.

17
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,760
The styling of the child applies.

18
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:16,230
So here I would have to set my age to style in the child to color the past in age to text.

19
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,410
So even though the age to tag is not written in this template but in the parent's template we do pass

20
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,280
it here in the end.

21
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,750
So that is very the style like this.

22
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,650
There is a second important thing to keep in mind and that works exactly the other way around.

23
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,280
Let's say the quote here would be some dynamic content.

24
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:42,950
So in the new instance here we would have our data function it is which returns the actual data object.

25
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:50,060
And in this data object we would have our quote title which simply is a string say the quote and then

26
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,890
up here we want to interpret this.

27
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,620
So here we output quote title.

28
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,190
Do you think this will work.

29
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,010
Let's have a look.

30
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,120
Actually it works.

31
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:09,900
So for compiling the template which means rendering any kind of view as Operation we're doing here.

32
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:16,710
The styling is something different but for anything else the component where you actually have to code

33
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,390
in the template will be the one doing the changes.

34
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:27,600
So here at the app component or the app root instance of you chase here is the one doing the changes

35
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:34,620
because even though we pass it to the child component it is indice components template that we use in

36
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,630
the first place.

37
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,630
Yes that gets passed down but still it's written in these components template.

38
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:47,390
So here is where we can use any future text we know including the if the for anything.

39
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,420
So that's the difference.

40
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,330
The styling is set up on the child component.

41
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:58,410
Everything else is handled on the parent component and this scope of compilation compared to the styling

42
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,580
scope is important to keep in mind.

1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:08,260
Off after learning about slots which allow us to distribute content I now want to add some other dynamic

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:14,740
thing we can add to our components specifically how we can use something called Dynamic components.

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,150
Now what are dynamic components.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:23,700
Well imagine you not only have your quote here which you registered as a component but you do have to

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,090
Aberg components.

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:32,320
Let's say you also have the app offer component and the app new component.

7
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:39,640
Now will strictly true Yate these files he earth so I have my offer that you file and then I have my

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:48,740
new dog view file for a lower case the here and then I'll quickly copy my code in there.

9
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,580
Remove the styling.

10
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:51,930
Don't need that.

11
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:58,280
And all I want to display here inside this div is age free tag where I say the offer.

12
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,440
So it's just some dummy content.

13
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,480
And in my new quote or excuse me my new component I also only want to display new code so we're not

14
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,300
able to do anything here because I want to show something else.

15
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,110
But we do have three distinct components now.

16
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:17,280
With that I can quickly import them here so the offer.

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,100
And of course all too.

18
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,980
Didn't you file and then assign it to your

19
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,880
so free component someplace.

20
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,720
We know that set up.

21
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,690
Now I want to dynamically decide which one to display here.

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,620
I don't want to display all free.

23
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,120
I'm not going to add an offer and so on.

24
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,440
I'm not going to add all the selectors.

25
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,050
Instead I only have one place here where I want to display any of the free components depending on which

26
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,640
button was pressed.

27
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,270
So I will add three buttons here.

28
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,870
Above is component part.

29
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,640
The first one will select the code component.

30
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:08,710
The second one will select the offer a component and the last one will select the new component.

31
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:18,510
To make this happen I'll add a new field in my data property and there I want to store the new property

32
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:24,560
selected component lets say and by default this shall be my

33
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,560
quote component or code written like this.

34
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,330
So the name of this selector here basically.

35
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,860
So this will be my default component.

36
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,570
And here when I click this I will set and click.

37
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,770
Well in this case here I want to say selected component.

38
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,580
Walts app quote.

39
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:55,670
So the default but in the average you case of course one to select app offer and here I want to select

40
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,090
app new.

41
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,010
Now that's not doing anything though.

42
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,950
Set this up so I can change this property but it doesn't have any effect.

43
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:12,540
We can see it if I printed out here and then simply output selected component to see if it generally

44
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,710
works.

45
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:18,510
So if you save this and I click it all for you we see it change.

46
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,080
But now I want you all to change d.

47
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,820
Actually loaded component down there to do this or should use a so called dynamic component.

48
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,550
How do we do that for this.

49
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:39,780
I will comment out the old selector here so that we still can see it but now I use the component components

50
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,260
here.

51
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:47,340
This selector is a reserved word just like slot component is also recognized by UJA and component allows

52
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:55,950
us to dynamically add components I can bind component to a property which holds the component which

53
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,120
should sketch which should get loaded.

54
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:06,540
So here to bind it I have to use D is attribute and use a colon to bind it to a data property so due

55
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,540
to a dynamic property.

56
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:13,710
And then I want to bind this to selected component like that.

57
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,980
What this does is an is a keyword of course.

58
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:23,700
What this does is that this component now gets bound to the selected component property down there which

59
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:30,390
is ABC1 by default and it will then have a look at the value of selected component which has to be a

60
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:37,410
string and that string is then interpreted as the selector of the component which now should get loaded

61
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,370
dynamically.

62
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,260
So AB code by default.

63
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:46,920
Therefore if I save this and I reload this while we still see it work but we don't pass any content

64
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:56,880
of course because I don't have a content in between if I now say default content here in between and

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,720
what we see that gets occupied by down there in our default slot.

66
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,540
Now watch what happens if I load the offer.

67
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:11,530
Now we the offer component and with new we see the new quote component end quote We go back to the default

68
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,790
content.

69
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:20,770
This is how we can use dynamic components to dynamically replace a part in our template with different

70
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:27,890
components triggered by for example button clicks and stored in a property which is bound with the East

71
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,670
keyword here.

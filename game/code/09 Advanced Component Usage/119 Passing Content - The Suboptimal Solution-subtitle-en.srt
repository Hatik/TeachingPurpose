00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:04,050
In a last lecture I set up this wonderful quote.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:12,050
Now I want to pass some content with props so I could set up a quote prop here and simply send a string

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:17,600
with single quotation marks inside there since I have a dynamic binding or without single quotation

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,070
marks and without the call and then to a wonderful quote like this.

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,590
I'm sending this with the quote attribute I setting on my component.

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,680
And then here I can add quotes to the object which I therefore First of all need to add.

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,290
So props and I would have my quote property and then I could of course here use string interpolation

8
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,840
to output that quote like that.

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,510
Now if it's safe does we still see a wonderful quote like before and that's perfectly fine I can now

10
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:57,120
set it from outside but maybe I not only want to set it like this.

11
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,980
Maybe I wanted to pass age to him all killed with that.

12
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,760
And this does not really work.

13
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:07,730
I can Pasay it like this or you can pass HVM or quote code.

14
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:13,850
We also learned how to output h HTML code here but that is really not how I want to use that because

15
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:20,970
if I got a more complex aged him or killed let's say my code should have a heading the quote and thereafter

16
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,090
with a paragraph which says a wonderful quote.

17
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,220
Well then I somehow would need to treat this string out of that.

18
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,060
And now I don't want to do that.

19
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,860
That's the short version of that story.

20
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:38,430
So here I will remove this property binding and will remove the proper property or to add will not output

21
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,860
it like this.

22
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:49,310
Instead it would be nice if I could simply pass this block of HTML code by simply enclosing it in my

23
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,380
quote here like this.

24
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:57,560
And then I could simply update it here it would be nice if it would have it in my template.

25
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,730
However if I do it like this will see that's not working.

26
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,480
It's an empty box so that is not how that behaves.

27
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,340
How could we change this.

28
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,640
Well we can change this with a concept called slots.

29
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:16,640
View Che's offers as slots we can reserve for content being passed from outside.

1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:08,340
Great so we learn how to use slots and how to be careful about where things gets changed.

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:15,130
So regarding the styling which has changed by a child and all the average safety UJA relate to things

3
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:21,180
which are changed or applied in the parent component where the template is actually set up.

4
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:26,280
Now what if we wanted to kind of do this a bit differently here.

5
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:31,240
Let's say I'm still passing my title and I'm passing my paragraph.

6
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:37,920
But then here in my template I'm going to have them rendered in two different places.

7
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:45,220
So let's say here in this div I have a number div and in there I'm one to have my title because this

8
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,660
has a class title let's say which will receive some special styling.

9
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:57,870
Let's say title would simply have and style of attack league.

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,390
And thereafter we would have a horizontal line and then we would have to content.

11
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:09,570
So I somehow want two different slots one for the title and then one slot for the content.

12
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,180
How can we achieve this.

13
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:19,430
Well if I say that like Dad we simply have it twice and one time we tell a one time not because now

14
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:23,230
with two slots the content is simply inserted twice.

15
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,840
It could be the behavior we want.

16
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,590
Baby you want to render it twice but here I want to split it up.

17
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:33,140
I want to render the title in the first slot and the paragraph in the second slot.

18
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:42,720
So how do edge chief that well we Kensit up named slots so I can give this slot a name of let's say

19
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,260
title and the slot will receive a name of content.

20
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:54,710
And then in the parent component where a half the content when I pass I can go here and add a new attribute.

21
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,740
This would be a slot equals title so slot of course is not an official aged Yamal attribute that's an

22
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:10,080
attribute implemented or introduced by viewed shapes and known by chess and chess will detectors slot

23
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:15,710
attribute and the nearest that deep part when quotation marks is the name of the slot.

24
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,520
It should render this content.

25
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,340
So in this case this first slot.

26
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,430
Now let's also set this up for in a paragraph where I say slot equals content and finally save this

27
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,420
and let it reload.

28
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,950
We now see it split up as I wanted it.

29
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:36,040
I do have my quote up here and then I do half the content.

30
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,940
It's not a wonderful anymore to be very honest but it behaves exactly how it should.

31
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:47,020
It distributes our content in two different slots and we tell it how to distribute that by setting up

32
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,850
names.

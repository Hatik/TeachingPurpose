1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:08,270
I am in an empty project again using bootstraps So again using the CD any year in the next HDMI file.

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:17,470
And here I want to mainly introduce two new features components have imagined the following case.

3
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:23,830
Let's create a new component in this folder and this project or create a new components folder first

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,440
of all and then the component of one to create will be called Code.

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,850
And that is just an example pick any name you want.

6
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,210
Now in this code component I want to use it inside of this column here.

7
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:43,660
So all I want to have here is of course so such a typical single template file here.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,870
So with my template and my script and some styles because I'll use some styles and in the template I

9
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:56,370
want to have a wrapping div and inside of the day of I want to have a quote.

10
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:03,990
So let's have a wonderful quote here and maybe wrap that in a paragraph that's even better.

11
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,600
So it is a basic set up.

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:13,470
Now I want to give to some styling so I want to go to Skull's to this template here so that it only

13
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,490
applies here.

14
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:23,660
And then this div shall get a border of one pixel solid and then some light gray border.

15
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:32,130
This one here and I want to give it some baulks shadow where I basically give it a bog shadow of one

16
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,270
pixel one pixel.

17
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:42,750
Let's say two pixels and black Let's see how that looks and a padding of thirty pixels.

18
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:49,150
And finally I also want to set the margin to auto to sender does.

19
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:56,160
Now with this styling squibbed judges quote here I can now of course use it all again just sort of locally

20
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,640
here.

21
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,370
I could register at Clovelly but I don't want to leave it at.

22
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,990
Quote and add my quote here.

23
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,680
Now for that to work of course I need to import the quote first so import code from components and then

24
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:15,420
code DOD view file and what as I can here use and quote like that.

25
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,720
Now if it's safe does it just how it is how it looks like almost how I want it to have.

26
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:27,450
Let's also add a top and bottom margin of search for the pixels to that and only have the left and right

27
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:34,380
set to auto to center it and I want to set the text alignment to center.

28
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,260
Forgot that.

29
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,950
So if that I got a wonderful quote.

30
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,900
Well while not super wonderful but it's OK.

31
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,560
Now the thing is I want to dynamically set does content from outside.

32
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,220
So from the parent component I could do this with.

33
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,310
Perhaps I could pass probs to that quote and therefore pastie text.

34
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,500
This quote would have.

35
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,270
So let's simulate these with props first.

1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:09,250
Were able to keep our components alive with keep alive here now as it is kept alive will we lose they

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,850
destroy lifecycle hook.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,240
What if we wanted to react to the navigating a way so that another component gets lower that we do have

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,740
to lifecycle hooks to control if either namak component is currently visited.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:29,180
So if it was activated or if we navigate the way so if it was deactivated and there were the two names

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,880
of these lifecycle hogs.

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,460
So any new component I can implement them here.

8
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,080
The first one is deactivated.

9
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:43,350
This will be executed whenever we are on the component and load and number one and number dynamic component.

10
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:52,820
So here I will simply log de-activated and the other hook is the active way that method well and that

11
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,440
obviously is called whenever we do load.

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,770
There's a dynamic component here so activated like this.

13
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:08,590
And now if we let this reload Let's go to you and you see activate it gets executed.

14
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,410
And when I click.

15
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,590
All for we see de-activated.

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,570
So these are just two new lifecycle hooks we can use now.

00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:08,650
In order to make sure our components get not destroyed or the namak components here I can wrap this

2
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,630
component in keep alive so this is a new research.

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:19,480
Keyword a new reserved component kind of into which you can wrap component and ask that name applies.

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,520
Keep alive.

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,030
Now make sure that this component is kept alive.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,460
So if I say if there's loads I go to new increased to counter I never get away.

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,410
We don't see destroyed because it wasn't.

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,940
The counter is still there.

9
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,580
And with that we preserve the state.

10
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,550
This is how we can use keep alive to do that.

11
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:46,900
But now you would correctly say well maybe I want to react to the fact that I navigate away before we

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,590
could use the destroyed lifecycle.

13
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,830
But now that's no longer called.

14
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,690
Do we have our lifecycle hooks we can use.

15
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,120
Let's have a look at the next video.

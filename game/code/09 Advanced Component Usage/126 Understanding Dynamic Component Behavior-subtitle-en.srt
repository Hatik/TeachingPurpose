00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:08,770
One important question when using this dynamic component approach is is the component actually recreated

2
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:09,980
when it gets loaded.

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,360
Or do we use an existing instance.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,160
So for example here when I wrote the app we have to quote component by default.

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,830
Now I go to offer this component is obviously create brand new.

6
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:27,910
Now what if I go back to quote was this component now or is it create newly or do we take the existing

7
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:28,540
one.

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:38,500
Well let's check this by adding a new button to our new component here and adding a data property.

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:45,490
So the function here which then as always returns our data object where we have a simple counter set

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,100
to zero initially.

11
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:52,950
Well up on clicking this button I want to increase the counter.

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:00,270
So here I will listen to click and simply said count plus plus directly accessing this counter property.

13
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,930
Now to see that in fact I will also output counter here.

14
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:11,560
Now if it stays alive we should be able to increase to counter navigate to an average component comeback

15
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,970
and still see the same counter if it is destroyed it should restarted zero.

16
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,350
Let's see what happens.

17
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,720
I go to you and then I increase that to let's say 10.

18
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:27,790
Now I go to offer and now let's see what happens if I go back to New It starts again at zero.

19
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,780
So the component is actually destroyed and recreated.

20
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,820
We could have checked the same with the lifecycle as a side note.

21
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:48,150
So here on NEW if I add destroyed and then lock console log destroyed to the console here.

22
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,900
Well we will only see what we already know but it is more interesting with the next step what I'm going

23
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:58,680
to show for go to new and go to offer we see destroyed was cold.

24
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:03,010
So the component dies we can override this behavior though.

25
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,810
And then the next with you I'll show you how to.

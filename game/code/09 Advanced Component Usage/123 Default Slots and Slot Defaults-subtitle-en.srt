1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:09,230
As a side note what you can also do is you could remove the contents slot here and also remove the name

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:15,590
for a second slot and then you would have a set up where you have one named slot the title and one unnamed

3
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,120
slot viewed as well treat the unnamed slot.

4
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,860
SD default slot.

5
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:28,270
So everything we're passing in which doesn't have a name slot assigned like title which has one Sodhi

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,480
paragraph for example which doesn't have a name slot assigned to it.

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,320
Such content will automatically be rendered in the default slot.

8
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:43,310
So saving this will yield the same result as before simply by taking advantage of future as default

9
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,580
behavior which renders unassigned content in the default slot here.

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:55,220
Speaking of defaults we learned how to render content in a default slot but we also can set up some

11
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,620
default content to be displayed.

12
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,460
Let's say we're not sure if we receive a third element.

13
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:09,380
Let's say we have a span here and in this span we want to have some such subtitle slot.

14
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:15,230
So here this name is subtitle and we don't know if we get some data passed in or not.

15
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,900
And actually turns out we're not getting it here right.

16
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,500
We only assign something to title and then to that the default slot.

17
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,110
We're not assigning something to the subtitle slot for such a case.

18
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,220
We could set up the subtitle here.

19
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:33,940
So let's give it some styling so that we can really see the difference and make it a bit Reya.

20
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:40,040
If any are saved us we see the subtitle here and there's just the default content which we simply introduce

21
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,050
by writing it between the opening and closing slot tag.

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:50,090
Whenever we do insert content this default content here in the middle will get replaced.

23
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,850
But it is displayed in our case where we don't have data being passed out from its outside.

24
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,640
So in cases where it does slot is an occupied.

1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:07,590
So throughout this module we've learned how we couldn't flexibly distribute content with slots and name

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:14,690
slots which gives us the power to create reusable components may be used in widgets like a slideshow

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:21,680
widget which has the same frame all the time but the content then has to be distributed in this frame

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,690
somehow.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:30,290
And how to use dynamic components to change which component is loaded in a specific part of the page

6
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:30,990
depending.

7
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:38,660
For example on the state of a property like we do it here when we save the currently selected component

8
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:46,040
of that property with that we get two amazing features which really allow us to create reusable and

9
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:53,970
flexible components and we're all dead we've learned so much about components in the last few modules.

10
00:00:54,020 --> 00:01:02,480
Now I'd say it's time to move on and learn about more fantastic features chase offers us but components

11
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,740
already are one of the best features and one of the most powerful ones.

12
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,610
But with that let's continue.

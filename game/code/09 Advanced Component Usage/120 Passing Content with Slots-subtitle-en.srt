1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:03,280
How do we use slots.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,310
Very simple.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,110
All they do is indie Chalte component where I want to receive data.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,590
I add does slot not Sloat slot component kind of.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:21,440
No this is a reserve the word Buquet as will the text and if I now save this we now see the quote now

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:28,550
a slot here is taking over and now renders the content we're passing from outside so it renders this

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,170
part.

8
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:36,530
Between the opening and closing select are here this is now what this slot does which allows us to pass

9
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,760
in data from outside and render it in the shell component.

00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,860
Well in this module we've already achieved a lot.

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:13,280
We had a detailed look at how this template syntax works how we can interact with our template and how

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:21,710
beauty really works and allows you to create re-active web applications and change and have played re-act

4
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,290
user events and much more.

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:31,730
There's a huge force there which really already gives you a lot of tools to create powerful new applications

6
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:32,570
with.

7
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:39,290
Now in the next module we're going to take this to the next level and see how we can conditionally render

8
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,370
some things in the DOM and output lists of data.

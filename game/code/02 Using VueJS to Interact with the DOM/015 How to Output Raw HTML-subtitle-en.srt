1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,890
Let's enhance it even more.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,700
Let's say we also have a finished link property here.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,060
And unlike de-link this is not just the u r l but it is the complete anchor tag.

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,920
We can write AGM all code here too just like that.

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,270
And it should also lead to Google com.

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:29,470
But of course the important thing here is that it is the complete link and not just as I just mentioned.

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:36,030
So we could enter a horizontal line here and below that horizontal line have a number paragraph where

8
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,290
I simply want to output is finished link to get this link to Google.

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,400
What do you think we'll see if I now had control enter.

10
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,790
Well let's find out.

11
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:53,160
We see the link as text we don't see a finished or are rendered aged him out element.

12
00:00:53,220 --> 00:01:00,560
Instead we see the h t m l element indexed for dishonesty default behavior of Eugenius.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,360
And this is great that it is the default behavior because this behavior ensures that we don't run into

14
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:13,950
any problems with cross-site scripting attacks by default view chase escapes aged him.

15
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:20,620
Which means it doesn't render HDMI elements it only renders text most of the time data is what you want.

16
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,940
But if you got some HDMI content where you'd know the source where is this coming from is safe or you

17
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:33,840
did sanitize it on your own before outputting it wasn't such a case you might want to output the HMO

18
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,880
code and not just the text.

19
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:43,830
Think of a block post which might have some editing inside of it for its such a use case you can get

20
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:49,380
rid of the interplay syntax with the braces and instead use another directive.

21
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,380
The directive would then be placed on the element where you want to output the HDL code.

22
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,100
And it is called the HVM.

23
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:05,190
This allows you to then pass the name of the property here which Holstege female code.

24
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:13,370
If I now had control enter you now see the link via HDMI touts beauteous to actually render aged female

25
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,790
code and not escape but again used carefully.

26
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,170
It does expose you to cross-site scripting attacks.

27
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:28,320
If this is possibly some content which for example gets created by your users and thus you can't control

28
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:35,370
what is placed inside of it if you know the source is clean or you sanitized it on your own you should

29
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,370
be good to go.

30
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,140
And this is how you can output normal H-G email through UJA us.

1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:07,610
You should feel a bit more confident with these first syntax with the double curly braces here.

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,970
We used quite a lot and I think it's clear what it does.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,860
What if you wanted to do something else.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,540
Let's say we have a link property.

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:24,270
And as the name applies if stories are linked to let's say Google or come now here in the paragraph

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:31,420
we might not only want to say hello we also might want to output this link so we could enter anger or

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:38,370
attack here and call it Google since this link leads to Google and then we could try the following use

8
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,730
our double curly braces here in.

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,430
RATH attribute to that output.

10
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:48,790
De-link if I had control ENTRAR we got our link here.

11
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:58,160
But if I click on it well you see it's not going to google at all what it actually does is it encodes

12
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,370
curly braces and tries to goad to call the raise call raise whitespace link whitespace quality grows

13
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,160
Calabresi so it tries to parse this as a link.

14
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,630
That is the normal thing to happen because your task doesn't work like that.

15
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:18,060
We can't use Cauley braces in any age female element attribute.

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,530
So this does not work.

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:28,820
We can't only use D-school braces in the place where we would normally use text not on HVM out elements.

18
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,580
What if we still wanted to buy this link dynamically.

19
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,610
That is certainly a use case you will oftentimes see in your application.

20
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,410
No worries.

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,820
You can do this.

22
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:47,670
We can bind it dynamically by removing Luling for now and then introducing a directive Buga US ships

23
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:57,270
with this directive is called We bind and does directive tells UK us hey don't use the normal attribute

24
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,960
here.

25
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:03,600
Don't use it like a normal H.T. mail at attribute instead bind it.

26
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,860
We do pass the argument to the Byne directive by adding a colon and the argument we do pass is then

27
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,990
the name of the attribute we want to bind.

28
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:19,350
So Rathi or by setting it up like this we can now pass a link here between quotation marks.

29
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,840
No call the braces still.

30
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:27,070
There's a steel link we don't need calling braces because we now already are in Buga as template language.

31
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:35,460
And with this if I now had control and I now tried this while you see I've now taken to Google because

32
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:40,680
now it binds to this state a dynamically Juta does the bind directive.

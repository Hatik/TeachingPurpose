Well so over the last lectures we learn a lot about outputting data listening to events transforming

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:17,410
data dynamically recalculating properties with computer properties watching our properties and much

3
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,470
more all the time.

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:25,750
We used Centex like this be on for events and we bind for binding two attributes of our elements here

5
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,210
like the RAF element.

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,300
Now if you use that and you're going to use this a lot there is a short cut a short a way of writing

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,370
this for events.

8
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:46,450
You can replace the on and the colon with an at sign you will recognize this and behind the scenes rendered

9
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,880
it are treated as V on colon.

10
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:53,540
But with at claim we're basically saying at the click event do the following.

11
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,940
So it's the same as a V on and and coal and just a short way of writing it.

12
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:04,840
And for the bind we get a similar shortcut we can remove the bind and just use colon.

13
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:10,810
RATH So the code now is exactly the same ASP for but a bit shorter.

14
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:15,600
And for the rest of course I will use the shorter code as there is nothing wrong with it.

15
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,610
And why not save some characters especially in a sense.

16
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,120
I believe this syntax is very readable as well.

17
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,410
So that's just something to be aware of.

00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:10,930
Before concluding these videos lectures here on outputting data with the interpellation or before the

2
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:17,980
bind and listening to events there's one important thing I need you to know or I need you to be aware

3
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,800
of.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,490
Right now we're most of the time using this in a way that once we output something we output a single

5
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:31,840
property like for the counter or x and y before we saw though that we also could call a function which

6
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,120
work fine.

7
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:39,340
That is by the way how we mostly use it for events here we simply pass the reference to a function to

8
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,450
a method we want to execute.

9
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:46,420
Be aware that in all the places where you can access your view instance.

10
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,970
So here when listening to a click event or here when outputting to counter so whatever we access or

11
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:59,050
you instance you can write any valid javascript code as long as it's only as one expression and doesn't

12
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:03,050
contain if or in statement or a for loop or something like that.

13
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,420
So simple charmless trip statements can be evaluated here.

14
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:17,230
So for example here I could duplicate my click button and here I don't want to call in trees but I directly

15
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,310
want to increment a counter by one.

16
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:25,990
Well I can simply call counterplot plus here and if I save this you see now I can click this button

17
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:32,950
just fine and it increments my code or my calendar excuse me the same Astrue here for the strange place.

18
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,480
I could easily output counter times to after saving.

19
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:44,620
You see that now I can buy two here even though I normally would only increment by one and here where

20
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,310
I do increment by two.

21
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,180
Well it's by for now.

22
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,210
So this is perfectly valid.

23
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:56,230
You could even write short Terminator expressions here like for example check if this is greater than

24
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:00,210
10 in which case you could say greater than 10.

25
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:08,780
Otherwise you could say smaller than 10 if you now had control and her you see that it is smaller than

26
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,810
then until I get a typo here.

27
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:21,470
But until I obviously sell to past 10 border this is how you can work with the templates here.

28
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,920
It really is a mixture of HDMI and Chava script code.

29
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:32,680
As long as you use template expressions like double curly braces here and this gives you this very strong

30
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:40,180
connection between your HDMI code your template up here and your javascript code your view instance

31
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:49,150
down there all managed automatically by chance and giving you thus the power to write very well powerful

32
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,230
and user friendly applications where you have this natural connection.

33
00:02:54,310 --> 00:03:00,610
Think about the effort code like this would take to write with Cheikh query especially once you introduce

34
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:07,930
more complex relations and need to do all this checking for possible changes in one part of your application

35
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,640
on your own.

36
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:17,140
Speaking of that we'll dive deeper into the reactivity of our properties in the next few ELECTRESS.

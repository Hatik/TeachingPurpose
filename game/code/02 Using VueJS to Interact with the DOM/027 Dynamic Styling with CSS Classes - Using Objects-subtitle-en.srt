1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,280
So we saw how we could attach and detach see us as classes conditionally.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,350
What if you don't want to store this object here in your aged Yamal template code.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:20,160
It's very simple here but imagine we would also have these blue class here for WCA SS class and said

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,340
just the opposite of a tetrad.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,900
If I now control this you see you can toggle between blue and red here.

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,930
But now this object grows Robert big.

7
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,940
Well I could go down to my view instance and create a new computer property for dead since it will depend

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,840
on my attach red property it needs to be computed.

9
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,730
So here I could call this day of classes.

10
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,150
And this of course is a function as all computer properties which should return me a javascript object

11
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,540
namely the object.

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:58,740
I set up here so in here I will simply have read attach red and then blue which is the opposite.

13
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:04,770
Now that of course won't work because keep in mind here in our chairs code in the Chalis code we have

14
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,940
to access the properties with this at the beginning.

15
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:15,450
Now if that change in place I can simply replace my object here with day of classes and if I save this

16
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:22,300
you see the same behavior as before but now outsourced in a property in this case in a computed property.

17
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:27,720
If you wouldn't have this dependency of course you wouldn't need to use a computer property and our

18
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,160
template is much cleaner again due you days being stored in our javascript code now.

1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:07,940
Well what are directives then if they allow us to do something like Dad how weak How could we describe

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:15,310
them what is a directive a directive is basically an instruction you place in your code future ships

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,990
with a few bolt in directives it aren't that many because the viewer has really covered pretty much

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,410
all the use cases you might want to cover.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,850
And as a side note you will learn later on how to write your own directives back to what it is.

6
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,250
It is an instruction and dis instruction.

7
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,400
The bind here tells Mujeres bind something to my data.

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:43,480
So bind something to the data and that includes all my functions which are stored in the future as instance.

9
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:49,250
So basically what we do here with the double curly braces for a case is where we can't use double curly

10
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:49,720
braces.

11
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,820
You want to put it like that.

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,640
The bind then takes an argument and general you pass arguments to directives by using a colon and then

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,910
the argument you want to pass and the argument it does expect is the attribute you want to bind.

14
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,910
So the reference of this link here.

15
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:12,980
Well and then between the quotation marks you just passed the property function whatever you want to

16
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:17,070
bind from your view as instance the link in this case.

17
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:24,230
This allows you to bind or to pass dynamic data to HDMI attributes something you would otherwise not

18
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,280
be able to do.

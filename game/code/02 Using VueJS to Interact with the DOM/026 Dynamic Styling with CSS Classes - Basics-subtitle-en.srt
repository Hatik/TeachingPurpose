1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,160
Still with me you are now really the kings of output data and listening to events.

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,190
With that we got a lot of things covered.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:16,830
You will use a lot in your day to day applications listening to user input and outputting transform

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,920
data or whatever Dator really is a core task you'll well have in all your applications and which really

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,140
makes up most of your applications at least when it comes to this front end connection so to rendering

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,350
it in the browser.

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:38,790
But there is one piece you will also use a lot and that is changing the styling attaching CSSA classes.

8
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,040
Look at this example on the right here.

9
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:48,120
I got three deaths here which are gray blocks by default because I set up this demo a C S S class.

10
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,900
No chase code involved here at all.

11
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,650
Yes I have set up this element connection but I'm not doing anything there.

12
00:00:54,810 --> 00:01:03,190
As you can clearly tell now it would be interesting to see how we can attach classes to these depths.

13
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,670
So let's quickly create free news SEUS ass classes.

14
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:15,260
Our ret class wage will set the background color to you guessed it red and then copying this class a

15
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,340
green class which does the same with.

16
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,380
Well surprisingly Drene.

17
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,990
And then the blue class which does the same with Lu.

18
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,160
So now we get three new CSX as classes here which you can use in our application.

19
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,560
Now of course I could attach it like that but that would be pretty boring right.

20
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,400
Let's instead see what you chase can do for us.

21
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,980
Let's start simple and say I want to attached is Regt block.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,990
Only if I click on this element and detach it.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,890
If I click again to be able to well showed us I'll add my data property to the view instance which is

24
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,390
hooked up to this code which has this as a template.

25
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,290
And here I will set up a new property.

26
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:06,300
I'll name it attach red and initially I'll set it to false to say no I don't want to attach it initially

27
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,420
upon clicking on it.

28
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,130
I want to set a tad shred to.

29
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:17,370
Well what it currently is not so the opposite with this exclamation mark.

30
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,570
I'm basically switching it from true to false.

31
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,980
And the other way around.

32
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,450
Now this is nice.

33
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,430
I'll just split this up over multiple lines so that it's easier to read but that alone won't do anything

34
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,990
as of now in order to conditionally attach a Osias as class.

35
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,380
I need to blind to the class property here and I can do this with colon class.

36
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,120
Notice that it doesn't matter that I already attach class here with the demo with colon clause.

37
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,670
I'm using the U.K.'s syntax and I'm not reusing the class attribute here.

38
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,990
Yes I'm binding to it.

39
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,580
But behind the scenes view chaps will merge this all into one class object.

40
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,170
So here I need to pass a Chavis crypt object as an argument.

41
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,840
This is just what view Cheras expects here.

42
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:12,090
And this object should be which C-s as class as a key.

43
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,990
Should I attach and as a value should I attach it or not.

44
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,060
So true or false.

45
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,580
No here I clearly want to attach the red C S S class.

46
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,850
So read like this.

47
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:30,180
You could also enclose it in single quotation marks and you would need to do this if your class contains

48
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,370
a special character like a dash but since it doesn't here I don't have to.

49
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:41,700
And then the condition will be attach red which is false initially but could be true if I now had control

50
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,560
enter.

51
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:50,370
You see I can now turn on and off this read class your you two does single code this single line of

52
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:58,050
code here where I set up my read clause as a key here referring to decease as property and connected

53
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,240
to attach read.

54
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,570
Which is true or false and switch constantly by clicking on this death.

55
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:10,530
Of course I could now copy that and also add a to a number of death and if I now save this.

56
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:16,080
Now both are of course switched on and off because they shared the same property attach thread which

57
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,370
is the one well deciding on the web where it should be attached or not.

1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:10,020
Ask before you can also combined is by here on the last step of creating an array were I for one said

2
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,080
my style.

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:21,210
But now let's say also pass as a second element a new object where I set the height equal to the width

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,160
plus pixels.

5
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:29,450
So even though it's cold with I can of course also used this value to set the height to create a square

6
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,470
again.

7
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:36,150
So now if I say this and I change this to 50 you see that the third block.

8
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:43,940
Now all is changed in both a width and height because I'm setting up both my style which sets color

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,690
and the width and this extra object which sets the height.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:56,600
This is how you can use styles and classes and bind directly to both classes and styles using the different

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,470
syntaxes to pass the styles and classes you want to pass.

12
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:07,760
One important note if you use styles binding like this Buquet will automatically prefix your styles

13
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,940
to work in all browsers supporting Buquet us in the first place.

1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:06,850
Let's enhance this little application a little more let's say we have a title.

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,370
Age One title and here I will output title.

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:15,970
Remember it is just hello world in say hello I will obviously do the same.

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:25,300
Even though I call a function now in this function Let's say I will set this title equal to just hello

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,560
like this if I now control.

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:35,610
Well we see Hello twice obviously because when we execute say hello we're overwriting the value of tile

7
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,400
we're setting it to just hello.

8
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,410
So we're outputting hello in both places.

9
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:47,980
Now what if intertidal we wanted to stick to the first initial value title had and don't want to change

10
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:53,120
it is if it changes later in our code like it does here we can do this.

11
00:00:53,130 --> 00:01:00,430
There is another directive you ships with which we can attach to an HDMI element which holds interpellation

12
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:08,890
like this one which is called B once by adding this tube element all the content inside of this element

13
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:16,090
will only be rendered once it will not be updated if it changes later on like here where we change it

14
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,450
in a later place.

15
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,700
If I now had control enter U.S. Hello world.

16
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:28,450
Because it keeps the initial value it doesn't that just once it is overridden you may have examples

17
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:33,910
in your application where you want this behavior and once then makes it very easy to stick to the initial

18
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:39,080
value and not use any other values this property might take at a later point of time.

00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:08,140
When working with you when there are a couple of things you oftentimes encounter in real applications

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,480
which you need to solve and as you learn chess makes solving these things easier.

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:19,390
But what do you what are these things let's enhance our application here by taking this paragraph where

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:24,560
we output the coordinates and I want to create kind of a dead spot.

5
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,040
So we're all entering a span.

6
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:33,520
And once I hover over days I don't want to update the coordinates.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,580
Now of course right now if I saved is it is still updated because this span is part of this paragraph

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:48,790
on which I'm listening to any mouse moves I can now set up my own event here and I will call it mouse

9
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,540
move as well.

10
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,010
And here I'm simply one to execute nothing.

11
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:02,320
Well one solution would be to still execute a function here so I'll name it dummy and add a down year

12
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,330
in the methods object.

13
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,720
Dummy of course would be a function.

14
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,640
And in this function.

15
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:17,330
All I want to do is I want to fetch the event which gets passed automatically and here I quit cold stop

16
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:28,740
propagation to make sure that it does not propagate up to elements holding this element this span here.

17
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:36,410
If an out of control you'll see that once a hover over to that spot the coordinates no longer get well

18
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,460
updated because now we're stopping the propagation which means only handle the element here.

19
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,850
And this handler don't let it propagate up to any elements which might hold this element.

20
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,800
Yeah we could do it like this but we can even get a bit easier than that.

21
00:01:53,990 --> 00:02:03,170
I can remove these dummy here and I can simply execute nothing here but use a so-called modifier event

22
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,080
modifier.

23
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,360
It allows me to modify the behavior of this event.

24
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,710
That's where the name comes from clever huh.

25
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:16,520
Here I add such a modifier by adding a dot after the name of the event which I pass as an argument to

26
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,310
be on anti-money for a one to use.

27
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,200
Here is Stob for stop propagation.

28
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:29,960
If I now had control enter we see the same behavior as before even though I don't even execute a function

29
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,150
here because verruca SNL does this for me.

30
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:40,190
It kind of has this interim mediate function which is between my function no function in this case and

31
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:46,190
this time when the event is emitted or when we get DB and it then runs this little function which simply

32
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:50,120
doesn't one thing it stops the propagation of the U-bend.

33
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,280
We also get other modifiers.

34
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:59,450
The Probably most important second one being pre-event for running prevent default so running stop propagation

35
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,380
with the stop modifier and prevent default.

36
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,290
The two common methods you have when working with the default event object.

37
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,800
These are available with these modifiers like Dot stop here.

38
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:17,780
You can also change them just as a side note by adding dot prebend here as well which won't do anything

39
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,420
here but you could add them or change up just like dat.

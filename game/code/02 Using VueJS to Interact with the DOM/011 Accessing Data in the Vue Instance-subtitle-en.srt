1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:09,540
This is especially important to keep in mind because in our instance if we here wanted to output the

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,450
title in this function so we don't want to return how low but we want to return the title then this

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,570
will not work because unlike in the template where we do have direct access to all these properties

4
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:28,580
and math that's UK as proxies them for us here in the javascript code that does not work.

5
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,550
But we still have an easy access.

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,950
You notice that the title property sits on an object which is called data.

7
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:44,730
And normally we wouldn't be able to access it by calling this title because this would not refer to

8
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,660
this data object here.

9
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,070
Thankfully ukase also provides us some magic here.

10
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:56,070
It proxies these properties and the same is by the way true for the method.

11
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,260
So it would all work that we call a method like this.

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:08,040
It proxy them in a way that by simply calling this anywhere in our instance object here will give us

13
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,020
access to these proxy properties methods whatever it is.

14
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:19,200
So we can call this tidal to access the tile in the data field because behind the scenes and I will

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,590
come back to this in the future.

16
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:20,840
Yes.

17
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:28,020
Instance module in this course behind the scenes viewed as kind of creates an easy access for us to

18
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,600
these properties.

19
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,190
That is the important thing to keep in mind here and especially keep in mind there is a difference in

20
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,880
a template.

21
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,000
We don't need this.

22
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:42,990
Here we do well and with this change in place if I update it again we see Hello world again but this

23
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,340
time by calling a function which now excesses our title property.

00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:08,250
We saw event Molly fires in the last video we not only have event modifiers we also have key modifiers

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,870
to demonstrate them.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,010
Let me add an input field here in this input field.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:20,700
I want to listen to the key event which obviously is fired whenever the user releases the key and the

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,680
key goes up here.

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:30,540
What I want to do is I want to throw and alert so called is alert me here and then down there in the

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:36,540
methods property at the alert me function.

8
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,940
So this shall get executed whenever we type something into the input field.

9
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,120
And here I simply want to throw in an alert which says alert.

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,210
Now this will probably get very spammy.

11
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:52,950
I saved this and I type here and yeah I get alerts.

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,130
Not really the best user experience maybe I only want to send an alert if I submit this.

13
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:04,460
So if I hit Enter lets say we can add a key modifier for days.

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:11,940
So like before with daubs stop for the event modifier a key modifier is also added by adding dot and

15
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,030
then the name of the key.

16
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:21,180
For example enter you will find attached to this letter a list of salable modifiers where to find out

17
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,630
which modifiers exist that enter exist exists you would also have dot tap dot e.

18
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:31,450
C You can also change them for example by typing Daut space.

19
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,300
And now if I hit enter or control enter and type here we don't see anything but I hit space.

20
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,530
We saw the alert I hit enter.

21
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,430
We see an Amber Alert.

22
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,730
This is how we can add our own key modifiers here.

23
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,210
And again a link to all the forest can be found attached to this lecture.

24
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:57,410
This enables us to only listen to specific keys but of course these modifiers are only available for

25
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,360
key related events like Key up here which makes sense I guess.

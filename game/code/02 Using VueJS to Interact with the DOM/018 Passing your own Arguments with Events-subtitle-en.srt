1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:10,640
What if we wanted to pass our own argument for example here when increasing the counter we're currently

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,230
incrementing by one.

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:18,890
What if we wanted to pass our own step by which is should get incremented nothing easier than that here

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:25,310
when calling Reise or setting up this reference I can also add parentheses and pass my own argument

5
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:33,230
for example to now of this I'd say or a one to say that I want to increase this countered by two since

6
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,070
I've passed a dozen arguments year.

7
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,560
I can go down there to my method and indeed increase function.

8
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:45,500
I simply listened to step or add the arguments step here.

9
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:52,290
I can then say this counter-protests equals Step 2 now increase it by ideas step instead of one.

10
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:57,660
So if I say this you're now a z i click and it increases by 2 all the time.

11
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,760
This is how easy I can pass my own argument.

12
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:07,800
And finally what if I not only wanted to pass my own argument but both my own argument and does automatically

13
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,530
created event object.

14
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,340
That's also very simple.

15
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,540
I can simply add a second argument.

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,160
And now here the naming is important.

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:23,130
Buquet us automatically fetches this default event argument and stores it in a kind of a variable we

18
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,260
can access your named dollar sign event.

19
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,260
So this is a protected name.

20
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,300
Don't write it and make sure to not get it wrong.

21
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,460
Doing it this way I can now also fetch this event here and it could use it in my increase method if

22
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:45,430
I wanted to too conveniently well use both my own argument and the automatically created.

23
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,730
And now also past event object future Chase gives us access to.

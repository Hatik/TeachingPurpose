1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,340
So back it cheers in a brand new project the very simple one as you can tell I do have my paragraph

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,330
where output a title and the title is simply as hello world here.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,030
So pretty much the same as we had in the first module Chester Frontex and a little bit leaner.

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:25,410
No event as of now because what I want to start with is this connection between this new instance and

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,530
does HVM all code.

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,080
I already explained that we have this kind of connection but there is one important thing to understand

7
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,140
which I want to highlight right now.

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,210
By creating this new view Chasey instance there and nodes that we don't store in any variable it is

9
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:50,160
still created though by instantiating DISA instance we do create this connection and view chance then

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,000
takes this.

11
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,920
Each team will call it up there and creates a template based on that code.

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:04,410
And this is important to understand Buquet asked does not add runtime use our aged Yamal code and have

13
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,670
these commands in our age HTML code.

14
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,470
You can actually see this if we inspected Hello World text here.

15
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,060
Then you'll see that here.

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,540
Of course we only have hello world we don't see any Colie bracers we don't see any AVL code which was

17
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,680
added by Buga has no hidden hint that there would be some magic going on.

18
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:33,270
Nothing at all future US creates a template based on our HTL code store staed internally and then basically

19
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:40,870
uses this template to create a real paged him out code which then is rendered as to dawn.

20
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,460
This is important to understand because this allows us to use templates syntax like that and like all

21
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:53,040
the other things that will teach you for all the scores in the HMO code we write because it's not the

22
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,980
one running in the browser in the end.

23
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:01,080
There is this layer in the middle and this layer is the Eugenius instance which takes our age do you

24
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:09,030
mean the code creates a template renders this template by example entering the title year and then outputs

25
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,570
the final HVM all code which gets rendered here.

26
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:18,660
You might have been aware of that already but if not this is really important to understand why we were

27
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,560
able to write the code as we do up here on the top left corner.

28
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,820
With that out of the way.

29
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:32,700
Well let's dive deeper into how we can interact with the DOM Brutus template approach by using Gujarat's.

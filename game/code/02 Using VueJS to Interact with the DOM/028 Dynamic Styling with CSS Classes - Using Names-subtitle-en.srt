1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:08,660
Sometimes you don't want to decide if a certain class should be attached or not but you want to calculate

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,390
or dynamically the arrive which class should be attached or not.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:22,130
Let's say we add a horizontal line and then the user input down there are blinded to my color property

4
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,960
which I'll set up here initially.

5
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:32,980
Also color to Green referring to does green C-s as close as I will use it on my last remaining Unseld

6
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,780
day of year where I want to set up class.

7
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,380
And now what.

8
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,560
Now here I simply will set this equal to color.

9
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,890
Well why did I call this property should be called Color.

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,790
Yep.

11
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:55,070
So now this is connected to the color property here and to color property is set for this input field.

12
00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:00,460
If I now save this we see the Krien class here and we see green in the input field.

13
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,260
That said I can go down there.

14
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:09,110
Delete Did you see the green class disappearing and I can change it to blue or two red whatever a C

15
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:09,830
S S class.

16
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,810
I have set up.

17
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,680
Now what's happening here.

18
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,720
I'm not determining if the green glass should be attached or not to have true or false.

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:26,060
Instead I'm directly outputting a class name here and this class name happens to be stored in this color

20
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,730
property which is settable for the input.

21
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:34,940
It could be set for anything doesn't have to be set fruit and put the key thing here is that I'm storing

22
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,550
the value and not if or not.

23
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,570
But instead what should be attached to class name.

24
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:47,140
You can also attach multiple classes but using the aere syntax no.

25
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:53,650
This syntax here will still work as you can see but now I could also add this condition here.

26
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,690
This Optik as a second argument.

27
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,490
Now I get a mixture.

28
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:03,730
I now always have my green KLOS years since I rode Kloot green here.

29
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,920
Now it's blue.

30
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:11,530
And now it's red but if I switch this back to blue and now I click on the first diff and remove blue

31
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:17,120
here you now see as red because now it also has to is red class attached to it.

32
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:24,080
Because I'm now setting up an array of classes which I want view chest to analyze and then merge it

33
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:31,210
all into one list of C S S classes based on whatever these items in the array resolves to.

34
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:40,010
And what do they resolve to they resolve to this color property which is a C as as class and to an object.

35
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,270
If it's an object then you chaps knows.

36
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:42,800
OK.

37
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:48,130
It's a key value pair where the key is C C S S class and the value is C condition.

38
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:54,680
If this class should be at Hach or not here attached to read is the property deciding whether to attach

39
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,760
a class or not.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,250
So we get both syntaxes using DC as S class directly or using an object where Denn the key s c is S

41
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,920
class and the value is to condition.

42
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,360
This is important to keep in mind because it gives you a lot of flexibility.

43
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,690
You see how much flexibility we got here.

44
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,580
We got so many different ways of calculating our classes and attaching them.

45
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:24,620
That really is amazing and should give you all the tools you need in your application to get the desired

46
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,380
result.

1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:08,800
So we saw how we can output a single property stored in the data field of view instance.

2
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:15,470
And it's important data stored in the view instance in the data property for example the title here

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,820
can be output in our template just like that.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,350
We don't need to ride this stock title.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,800
We don't need to write data it's title we have access to all the properties in the state object just

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,850
like that.

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,550
And that's really important to keep in mind of course this makes outputting it very easy as we don't

8
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:41,780
have to manually access or view instance or save it in a variable which we then would access no.

9
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,480
All of that happens behind the scenes for us.

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,990
We can access all properties in the data object just like that.

11
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,400
Not only data object though.

12
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:58,490
If we reintroduce the methods key which we already saw in the first much of this course where we can

13
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:05,900
store some methods of this future instance then I can create a new method here and I will name it.

14
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,480
Say hello.

15
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:14,540
Now say hello of course is a function and all it does is it returns Hello.

16
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,810
So it returns a string.

17
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,870
We can take our paragraph here and then execute.

18
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,640
Say hello here.

19
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,470
Don't forget the parentheses.

20
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:32,970
What this will do is that whenever Mujeres renders our template it will still parse is call embraced

21
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:37,520
syntax and it will then execute the function inside of this.

22
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,200
Now what do you think we'll get.

23
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:46,280
I'll hit Control enter here and James for Will to quickly update the HDL code and we can clearly see

24
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,700
how low this happens because it's perfectly fine to execute a function in between a call he braces.

25
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:58,310
The important thing is that it returns something which can be output here in the dorm.

26
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:06,680
So basically something which can be called Word it to a string no complex object or no return value

27
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,160
at all.

28
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:12,890
It has to be something which can be converted to a string and then it's perfectly fine to call a function

29
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,490
like this.

30
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:22,000
Second important take away as you can clearly see I'm accessing say hello in the same way I before Access

31
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:26,530
title without this without Moffats without anything in front of it.

32
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:33,740
So we not only have access to everything stored in the data just by typing the name here but also to

33
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:39,900
anything stored in the methods property that is also something important to keep in mind.

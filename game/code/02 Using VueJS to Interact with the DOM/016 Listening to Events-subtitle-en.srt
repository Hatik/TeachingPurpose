00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:08,750
Bag I am in the chase for the editor in a very basic Mujeres application again get disburden and discount

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,510
data property which I'm out putting down there.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:18,640
I want to hook up this button that when I click on it it increases to counter what we already saw how

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,410
to hook to Spagna But now we understand a bit better of what happened back then.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,280
I'm using a number directive v on.

6
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:34,210
And if the bind allows us to bind something in our template to pass data to it then the honest kind

7
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:40,990
of the opposite we bind to something or better said we listened to something to receive something from

8
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:41,830
our template.

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,610
And what do we want to receive here.

10
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,250
Well an event.

11
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:51,130
So we on all the takes an argument and the argument is the name of the event we want to consume more

12
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,550
we want to listen to.

13
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,700
So let's say the event here is click and you're not limited to click.

14
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,370
You can use any damn event system for a button.

15
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:07,580
This would include mouse enter mouse leave whatever default Dom events are on a button and here you

16
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:13,870
then pass as an argument or on the set of the equal sign between quotation marks the function or the

17
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,980
code you want to execute when clicking on this button.

18
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:24,490
Now let's hook it up to a function all name ID increase and I'll add it down here where I'll add my

19
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:36,190
methods block and then the increase function where I obviously want to access the counter and increase

20
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:40,730
the value by 1 if I now had control and click this button.

21
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,320
You see it increase there.

22
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,740
So that was pretty easy I guess.

23
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,070
Now let's dive deeper into events and learn more about them.

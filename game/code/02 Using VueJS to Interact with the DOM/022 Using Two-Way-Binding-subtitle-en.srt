1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:10,660
Before diving deeper into how we can make our properties work closer together let's have a look at working

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,860
with the template again.

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,520
We saw how we could output data.

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:18,820
For example here with string of tribulation where we output the name we saw we could listen to events

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:25,740
like with key up for example one of the wants to do both at the same time two way data binding that

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,530
would be for example here I get this input field and I want to populate this input field with the name

7
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,340
of the user.

8
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:39,040
So with my name in this case here on the same time whenever I change it in the input field I want to

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,130
update the data property and updated everywhere I outputted in my code.

10
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,750
For example in this paragraph turns out it's really easy to set us up with huge.

11
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:56,810
All we need to do is add the the model directive to the input element of the model directive tells you

12
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:03,790
to set up two way data binding for days input here and then between the quotation marks the property

13
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,570
which you want to bind in both directions the name in this case.

14
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,450
So what this will do is it will on one hand.

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,880
Easy as you can see here output the name in the input field.

16
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,490
But then whenever I change it here it will listen to these changes and update the name property in my

17
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:27,970
view instance that's reflecting the change in all the places where all also the name instance like in

18
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,140
this paragraph.

19
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:34,960
While this is the missing piece when we are talking about data binding where we were able to use the

20
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:42,460
interplay in the bind syntax to bind two attributes divi on syntax to listen to events.

21
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:47,010
Well now we can also use Q8 binding to do both at the same time.

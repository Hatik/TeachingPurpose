1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,030
For example one important thing about events is the default event object.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,530
We can listen to you.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:14,820
There is this event object created by a a script or by the dorm which holds some information for example

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,810
on a click event that holds the coordinates of where does click event happened.

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:26,790
Now let's say we want to access this information because we might be interested in outputting that data.

6
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:36,540
So I'll quickly add a new paragraph here where I will say coordinates and I want to output the coordinates

7
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:46,710
here so that will output the x coordinate and then let's say next to it it will output a y coordinate.

8
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:54,990
Now of course these two don't exist so quick so quickly set them up here X and Y and then up and hovering

9
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,150
over this paragraph.

10
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,540
I want to update these two values.

11
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,230
So here I can say we on Mouaz move.

12
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:12,440
And execute up they'd coordinates Well let me quickly write this math down here.

13
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,860
Update coordinates.

14
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:21,850
And now I would need access to the coordinates I would need access to this event object which gets created

15
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:30,490
automatically turns out it not only gets created automatically by Thornbury by javascript it also gets

16
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:38,880
passed automatically to each function we execute frood is the future as the on binding your view chaced

17
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,600
dusters for us.

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,750
So here I can conveniently execute event.

19
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,830
And of course this should be a function tiny mistake here.

20
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:58,000
So I can conveniently pass event here and then here I can say this X equals event client X as it turns

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,190
out to be.

22
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:08,500
And to this why you went client y blind X inclined y you're already for properties names of event object

23
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,090
has nothing to do with Buquet us on.

24
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:15,730
I also renamed as to update coordinates as I call it pure.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,890
You now see once I hover over it these coordinates here update.

26
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,280
This is a how we can listen to something else ten than a click.

27
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:32,050
But be very importantly it shows us how we can past this event object which again is created automatically

28
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,450
and use it as we do here.

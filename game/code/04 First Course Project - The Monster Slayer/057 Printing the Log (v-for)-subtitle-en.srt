1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:06,490
So we're adding actions turns to dust turns every day.

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,400
We want to output this on our page.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,200
No because having it in the code alone doesn't do that much.

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:20,840
So in the next AGM or page I'll go to this Lockes area where I have a list item and now a way to output

5
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:27,950
data which is an array or which is a list is of course to use the before directive beauteous officers

6
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:35,360
with that directive we can loop through all items in an array for example by running turn in Turin's

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,110
here.

8
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:43,050
Turtles of course refers to my Turin's data field or property here in this data object.

9
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:49,210
And turn is a name of my choice so I can name this whatever I like.

10
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:54,890
Now that I loop through that I can output it here with stricken translation by saying turn and then

11
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:01,410
accessing text which I know will be available sends We passed some tags here.

12
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:07,780
For example when we create a new entry in the log with base let's save it and reload.

13
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,740
And if I now start a game an attack we see that this works.

14
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:17,630
It could use some improved styling and all of four other attacks it only works regarding the monster

15
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:24,170
damage because we're not logging the user damage yet but we can see that outputting it a here clearly

16
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:30,870
works though if we restart we see that we get this empty box here even though the log is empty.

17
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:37,850
So it would be nice in the next HDMI code to only show this section if we actually do have entries in

18
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,980
the log to do that.

19
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:46,850
I'll add divi if here to only conditionally attached this aged team out section and all its children

20
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:52,070
to the dawn and to condition of one to check is if turns out of length.

21
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:59,370
So if this array has a length greater than zero if not then it is empty then I don't want to attach

22
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,960
this section because I don't want to show it a lot.

23
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:07,580
Then with this let's save and reload you'll see the boxes gone.

24
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,160
But as soon as I attack it's back and we're seeing the log.

25
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:17,560
Well next let's finish it by hooking up the other buttons and improving the styling here a little bit.

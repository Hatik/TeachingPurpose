1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:06,300
We want to hook up the other buttons to also print deep layer damage.

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,060
And then I want to improve the styling so that we can easier see here.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,960
That was the monster or the player attacking here to do so.

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:19,930
I'll go to the app chase file here and I'll copy this Turin's and shift code.

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,650
And yes again this could all be refactored.

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:30,400
But since it isn't that much code I'll keep it like this and all the edits here hits monster hard for

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,870
the damage let's say.

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:40,040
Of course before does have to store damage in a separate variable again like that and then deduct this

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,950
variable from the monster health.

10
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:48,970
We don't need to change monster attacks we already got our logging edition there and for healing.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,630
We of course also want to note that we all want to copy that code here or put it in your and say layer

12
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:06,980
heals for and we know it's always 10 so we can say for 10 simply you were an industry like this.

13
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,280
These are the actions I have.

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,440
Now one thing I also want to do is up on giving up or let's say up on starting a new game I want to

15
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:23,570
set this turns back to an empty string an empty array excuse me so that I reset the log.

16
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:31,260
With that with this I added log actions to all items we can see that if I reload and now I attack here

17
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:38,110
we see that we get the lock for that and is for a healing and that if I hit it give up and start a new

18
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:38,580
game.

19
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,450
The log is cleared.

20
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,600
Missing pieces.

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,310
It would be nice to have some coloring to quickly see which action stems from the player and which attack

22
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,010
was launched by the monster.

23
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:55,100
So let's do this by conditionally attaching some styles or classes to.

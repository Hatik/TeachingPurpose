1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,040
We're almost done we're able to attack and heal.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:09,840
Now we want to implement the method to give up what should happen if we click this button while we want

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,330
to set gamest running to false because it isn't running anymore.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,190
And then there's this all all come back that is later on.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,760
But for now this is really all I can see it in action.

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,570
If I fight a little bit and then give up it's over.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,370
We can start a new one.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:35,660
Go back to 100 and start fighting again like that wonderful with dad.

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,170
All our action buttons are hooked up.

10
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,290
I now want to work on this section which doesn't display anything yet.

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:49,290
I want to show a log showing as precisely how much damage we dealt how much damage we healed or how

12
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,750
much damage we got by the monster.

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,560
So let's implement this logging functionality next to wrap up and finish this project.

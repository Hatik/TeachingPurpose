1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,140
So where are you successful let's build it together.

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:12,970
These are the assets you got these asphalt 40 foundation grid I'm using and my own see us fall forward

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,130
Stults all use for this project here.

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,040
Then I got the index page Steimle fall with obviously the AGM all killed and now it's time to add a

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:27,050
script we could it in line here at the end of this or simply add a new script file.

6
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:33,780
So I'll add a new app dot js file which of course I need to import in my index HVM I'll follow.

7
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,630
Now and Here.

8
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:41,540
So here are all imported script source equals app dot J.S. with this.

9
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,270
I can now write my app here in the app yes file.

10
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,610
And for writing this of course we have to consider which features do we have.

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,020
Well if we have a look at the application we get our health bars so we certainly need to control the

12
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,400
health of each player.

13
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:04,620
So probably makes sense to kind of yeah I have two properties for that.

14
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:10,070
We conditionally don't want to change the style depending on that health and we want to output it as

15
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,480
a net number as text here.

16
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:19,760
We also got these buttons here for which we need some methods to execute when we click on them to start

17
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:27,020
a new game and to have our special things we can do here like attacks special attack heal and give up

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,820
and then we might need some additional functions for example to render or to simulate the monster attack

19
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,780
turn to generate a random number to add a turn to days.

20
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:45,090
Logwood outputting down there which we as a side note also need to store in some kind of array.

21
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,710
And yup this looks like the things we will need for days.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,710
Now I want to start simple by setting up the player health and outputting it there and adding a conditional

23
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,710
style depending on the player health.

24
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:06,530
So that later on when we add functions to change this we can directly see this being reflected in our

25
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,330
application to execute this application.

26
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:17,580
You can simply double click on the index file and executed in the browser like this.

27
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,350
Now this is not how it will look in the end does this just without any javascript code added to it later

28
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:28,850
in of course we will have more complex setups where we use a little development server to host our application

29
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,740
on the local machine.

30
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,730
But right now we don't need that and can work with this perfectly fine.

31
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,290
So let's dive into that.

1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,790
It covered a lot of the basics.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:08,560
Until now we learned how we can interact with the template of future as how we can output data there

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:14,410
how we can listen to events and we also had a look at how we could conditionally render content with

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:22,780
B if we show and how we can Rendle lasts I'd say before we dive into the depths of view has learn more

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:28,960
about what is viewed as instance for using Lets take the knowledge we gathered until now and let's build

6
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:34,880
our first course project so that we could actually see what we can already do with that knowledge.

7
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,100
We're going to build this little game here.

8
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,610
We fight against a monster here.

9
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:45,370
And once I click on Start new game we got the ability to attack to make a special attack to heal or

10
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,570
to give up.

11
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:53,020
Well as you can see by a tech I do a random amount of damage locked down there and I also take some

12
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,120
damage as the monster has a chance to attack me.

13
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:01,850
I can also launch a special attack and if I take too much damage of course I can heal up here.

14
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:08,380
You can see that the monster still attacks me but overall I should gain somehow if at least and if I

15
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,820
get a feeling this all is not ending well.

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,230
Well I can always give up and therefore start a new game.

17
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:21,070
But now let's quickly defeat this monster here and yet we won and can't even now start a new game again

18
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:26,110
or just cancel and start a new game here or leave.

19
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:32,890
This is the very basic application just a little game and as you might already be able to tell it uses

20
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,170
a lot of the things we practiced.

21
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:40,780
It clearly listens to events it conditionally shows you different but the sentence log which is clearly

22
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,070
a least getting rendered.

23
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:49,400
Here we have our health Baras here which are kind of managed bowed by the application and much more.

24
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,670
So this is what we're going to build now.

25
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,580
The challenge for us.

26
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,720
Try building this on your own.

27
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:04,160
Features used are of course be it for conditionally showing things before for this list were per always

28
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:08,260
somehow setting the styles on the monster and our health bar.

29
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:15,310
And we need some methods to be executed whenever we click one of the buttons again when we click attack

30
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,410
or any button besides give up.

31
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:23,830
We always have two rounds getting executed hour round where we do some damage or heal ourselves and

32
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,270
around for the monster where it is able to damage us.

33
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,480
This is the challenge.

34
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:35,290
Try building this game and thereafter we'll do this together and you can compare your solution to mine

35
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,050
challenge.

36
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:44,590
Mine obviously and see how isolated is the styles and the general HVM code for this project can be found

37
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:50,380
attached to dissuade you so that you don't have to worry about setting this interface up but can really

38
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,190
focus on the javascript code.

1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:08,760
We want to make this start new game button work and then display these action buttons to do so we need

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,310
to hook it up to a band listener.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,580
So here on the button we start a new game on it.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,530
We want to listen to the click event.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:25,280
And I can do this with the on click or shortcut just at click to listen to a click event.

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:31,530
Now here I want to execute the code where I want to run the code which should get executed when we ever

7
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,260
whenever we click this button.

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,710
Now I could simply set.

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,690
Game is running to true here.

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,660
But actually that's not all I want to do here.

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,500
Hands since I can only write one expression here.

12
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,010
And anyway I shouldn't to put too much code in my template.

13
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:53,700
I will simply execute the start game Meffert putting you reference here like this.

14
00:00:54,060 --> 00:01:03,090
And in my app yes I'd therefore add my methods object to the instance and here at the start game function

15
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,640
like this.

16
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,500
So this is to start.

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:15,010
Game function here and in this function I want to set this game is running to true.

18
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:21,870
I also want to set the player health to 100 in case you already had a game running before and wasn't

19
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,120
100 anymore.

20
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,280
And the same is of course true for you monster health which should now also be 100 again.

21
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,410
So this is the start game function.

22
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,900
And if we save this now and reload the application and it clicks start you game it correctly switches

23
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,340
to displaying the other buttons instead.

24
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,400
Great.

25
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,790
So the game is running deep layers are initialized.

26
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,230
Time to make these action buttons work and actually start hitting each other.

1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:08,560
In the last lecture we refactored our code so that we have to check with function checking if we are

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,840
lost or won and that we also have a new function for calculating the damage.

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,630
With that the attack function working fine.

4
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:24,080
We now want to implement the special attack in general he copied the code from up here as a side note.

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,100
Always a good sign that you can refactoring something.

6
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:33,670
But for hearable leave it like this and I set up this to deal damage between 10 and 20 sensitives are

7
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,440
a special attack.

8
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:42,820
Now in here of course all they want to check if one after dealing this special attack here and there

9
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:47,600
after we again want the monster to attack and this should always steal the same damage.

10
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,200
So I can copy the code from up there.

11
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:58,970
And yet we get some code duplication here especially the monster attack which is always the same deal

12
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,130
the same damage.

13
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,460
That is something we might outsource.

14
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:07,690
Yes we could also refactored the player damage but I will leave it here so that we can quickly see what

15
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,850
each attack does.

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:18,130
But I definitely want to refactor the monster damage so let's do this all add a new function which all

17
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,670
name monster attacks.

18
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:29,740
This is a function here and in this function here I simply copy in the code I just copied where I reduced

19
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,580
the player health and deal this damage.

20
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:39,820
This now means that here where the monster dealt damage I can now simply execute this monster attacks

21
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,620
like that here.

22
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,290
Q And with this emplace Let's have a look at the application again.

23
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,640
Let's start a attack special attack dealing more damage yet we're clearly winning here.

24
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,590
You won.

25
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,410
New game works just as well as before.

26
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:01,760
Now with the extra tech and the monster damage now also really factored.

27
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,990
To have a bit more cleaner code.

28
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:09,530
Next we want to implement the healing and go away from dealing damage to healing damage.

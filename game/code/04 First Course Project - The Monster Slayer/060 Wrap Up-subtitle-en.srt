1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:09,240
In this module we created a complete application with Buquet as does Monster Slayer application here

2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:18,570
I hope is saw how easy it was to use the chase here through view as we could really focus on our core

3
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:27,220
game logic writing the javascript code to handle different attacks handle our health but not to fetch

4
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:33,180
the right element in the dorm to check the current value to check if it needs to be updated to keep

5
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,910
everything in sync manually.

6
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,850
How we would have to do it with that nilla javascript or Cheikh worry.

7
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:46,020
Instead we set up some easy connections like here with the for loop or like here with the health.

8
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:54,270
We stored some data in our data property and recognize we only have four properties in there and let

9
00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:01,230
me get a couple of functions where we manipulate these properties and hence future takes care about

10
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,320
the rest automatically updates everything automatically keeps everything in sync.

11
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,430
And with that we built our first the U.K.'s application with the tools we've learned thus far.

12
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,330
And I can tell you there's much more to come but I hope you'll already see that we achieved a lot here

13
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:24,440
already and which great application we were able to build with the things we've learned thus far.

14
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,370
Let's continue to the next muchall.

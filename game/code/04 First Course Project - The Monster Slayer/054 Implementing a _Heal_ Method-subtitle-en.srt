1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,780
So after dealing damage we now want to be able to heal.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,630
We could also calculate the healing amount randomly.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,220
But I want to hard code.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,770
Let's say we always heal by 10.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:19,600
So here I don't want to set this player health plus equal 10 to increase that by 10.

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,470
Also keep in mind the monster shella tech.

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,740
So here we also have to execute monster attacks thereafter.

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:36,620
Now after saving this let me reload start a new game special attack heal up special attack and we won.

9
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,790
Now here's an issue I can also heal if I'm old for health.

10
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,710
Well this really grows my health bar right.

11
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:51,340
So we don't want to be able to heal any higher than our maximum health of 100 let's say.

12
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:59,740
And therefore here we should all to implement if check if our player health is smaller or equal to 90

13
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,540
then we can heal for the full 10.

14
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:12,670
So then we want to ask tend to our health but otherwise we only want to set our player health back to

15
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:20,590
100 again so that we simply heal back to full if we're at a value higher than 90 anyways.

16
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:26,800
So if this plays if I reload healing does nothing when at full health it actually reduces our health

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,850
because the months are still attacks us but if we go lower Well then we can still heal.

18
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:38,540
So this is how we can heal up how we can implement this mechanic and as a side note.

19
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:45,380
I hope you recognize that since a couple of bridges were mostly riding normal Javascript code.

20
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,530
This shows you how powerful view says.

21
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,270
We set up our style by nothing here.

22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:58,630
We hooked up our buttons and we showed our player healthier and now using the view its sense of normal

23
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,830
Charles group Code.

24
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,880
We're creating quite a nice game here without having to write any complicated code or manually updating

25
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,680
parts in a dorm manually checking if we need to update a certain values somewhere.

26
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:19,120
Really this is how you use your chess and why it is so powerful and wide helps you so much.

1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:08,500
I'm going to create a calculate damage function for it so I'll simply name it calculate damage here

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:14,420
and this shall be a function which expects to arguments the minimum and the maximum damage we want to

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:22,790
have as boarders for this random number here I don't want to return this function here where I do calculate

4
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,560
my damage.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,950
I want to return this using the maximum and minimum I'm passing Tudor's function here with debt.

6
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:42,080
I can remove that and simply say damage equals this calculate damage and past free and 10 the minimum

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:51,130
and the maximum much easier I can now do the same for the monster here where I also can remove all of

8
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:56,920
that and simply reduce the player health by this calculate damage.

9
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,390
And now five and 12 that would be a possibility how we can't write this year.

10
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:08,350
Q To make this code even shorter so with debt I have refactored my damaged calculation.

11
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,620
Now I want to check if I won.

12
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:20,420
So hirable add a new function which I'll name check when this will be a function where I want to execute

13
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,300
the code checking if we lost or won.

14
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:32,300
So what I do here is I just copy my code from up here if the monster health is smaller than 0 in which

15
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:39,440
case I don't only want to frilling alert let's say but I want to ask the user if he wants to start a

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,390
new game.

17
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:46,670
So all the shoji conferred on dialogue and I want to check the result of the dialogue by running if.

18
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,730
Confirm.

19
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:54,050
Confirm again is a bold and function offered by javascript giving us this yes or no dialogue which we

20
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,510
can't click them.

21
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:04,790
And here I'll show you one new game in which case if this is true so the user clicked yes I want to

22
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,920
call this start game.

23
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,840
Otherwise if the user did not call this or did not want to start a new game I only said game is running

24
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,720
to.

25
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,360
But we don't start a new game.

26
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:25,730
I always want to return here because I also have a Altes block here specifically I Altes if block because

27
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,640
here I want to check if the player health is smaller or equal to zero.

28
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,130
Not the monster health.

29
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,460
In which case we lost.

30
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,590
So you copied the code from above.

31
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,330
You lost new game and then again this start game.

32
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,180
And I guess you could refactor this even more.

33
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:47,190
But I want to keep things easy to read and to understand what's happening here.

34
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:57,180
Now here in this case I want to return TRUE actually the same appear and only if we satisfy no condition

35
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,780
down here.

36
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,910
I want to return false.

37
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,510
Why do I want to return a boolean here.

38
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,240
Because the place for a execute check when up here.

39
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,900
Here I need to check if we should continue in this function or not.

40
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,990
So we'll check if does check when returns true which is always the case if we either lost or won.

41
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,590
So if we return shoot here I know I don't want to continue to code execution here because the game is

42
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,070
over.

43
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,270
So I don't want to deal damage again.

44
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,630
We instead ever start a new game or nothing.

45
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,270
So here if we have a return true.

46
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,870
I know I have to retreat from this function so that we don't execute the code anymore.

47
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:47,520
At the end of the function I again will have to check if we won but here I can only say this check win

48
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,000
because there is no code getting executed after this function.

49
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,130
So no need to return in case we lost or won because nothing's happening.

50
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:04,170
After calling this function which doesn't play as safe this reload and see if this still works I click

51
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:11,030
attack until we oh this is a close one but until we lost I guess you won.

52
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,200
Yeah we were really really lucky.

53
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,560
I can now click OK let's try it again.

54
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,430
You lost.

55
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:18,980
OK.

56
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,830
And then cancel so we get one tile are too much.

57
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,990
And this of course is from this check here which I also have to remove.

58
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:34,940
So with this our code here is much more readable and we refactored it to all who use it in our other

59
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,710
functions which are to follow here.

60
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,460
With that we're able to attack.

61
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:47,010
Now it's also time to implement our especial attacks and well heal and so on to really make this game

62
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,210
a bit more flexible and give us a higher chance of winning.

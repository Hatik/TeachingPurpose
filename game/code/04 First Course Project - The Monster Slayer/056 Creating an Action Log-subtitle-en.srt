1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:08,970
To manage some law here or treat to slog I'll add a new property to the data object.

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:16,630
I'll name it turns because I want to store and separate turns of the game there and then lock them to

3
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,070
this page to this area I'd set up for this.

4
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,800
So how should turd's get updated.

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,900
How do we want to manage our turns.

6
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:34,870
Now if we attack for example then I want to push a new turn on this Turin's aere.

7
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:44,720
So here after attacks I want to add and U-turn so I can say this torrents and I don't want to push it.

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,160
Actually I don't want to add it at the end.

9
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,940
Let's say I want to add it at the beginning.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,360
The opposite of pushed is on shift.

11
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:58,780
So this adds just turn as the first item in the array and shift all the items one element to the right.

12
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:05,960
So to say so I want to shift a new item on this turn every disappear.

13
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:11,330
Object where I determine if it is the player who did this turn.

14
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,380
I'll set this to true here and then some text.

15
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:22,710
Now the text should be what we did and how much damage we dealt or how much we healed.

16
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:32,660
So here we could say player hits monster 4 and then here the value should be the damage.

17
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:37,040
Now for that I need to store damage in a separate variable.

18
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:44,320
I can use it like this anymore so let's simply use a separate variable here to have the damage Idel

19
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,160
to your and this should store this in days.

20
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,240
Turin's array.

21
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,330
Now let's see if this works and we'll have to fine tune this little bit later.

22
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,990
But for now let's also all added for the monster and the monster attacks a year.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,870
Here we want to say monster hits player 4 and all the stored damage year in a separate variable so that

24
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,190
we lock the correct damage here.

25
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,600
We clearly can't call this calculate damage down there again.

26
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,630
We would get a new random number and of course this is not the player.

27
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,920
So let's set it to False.

28
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,440
With this set up we are adding items to our array.

29
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,740
Now we also want to print this array in the index HVM Alphonso that we can see it.

30
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,980
So let's do this in the next video.

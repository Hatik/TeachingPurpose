1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:03,610
Get the health bar someplace.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:10,060
Now we want to be able to start a new game and switch from non-game mode to game mode.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:17,030
Remember we're tracking the current mode here with the games running property and well since we do track

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:24,440
it year it would be a great start to go to the U.S. holding our start new game button and at the Wii

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,620
if directive of your q conditionally showed a section or not show it.

6
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:37,060
We only want to show it if a new game is not running so if game running is false in this case I will

7
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:42,930
show you start new game buttons so hearable check if game is running is false.

8
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,990
That's why I have to say exclamation mark at the beginning.

9
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:51,850
On the other hand on the section below where I have my special back Anstee attack but and so on.

10
00:00:52,030 --> 00:01:00,010
I could now said we have equals game running simply to check if this is true or simply check the out

11
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:00,590
here.

12
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:06,220
Since the first three Fs placed on a section and the element directive following that is the one we

13
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,970
want to conditionally show if the first condition is not met.

14
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:16,390
So if this block here is not shown we can use violence here to alternate between this section and this

15
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,270
section.

16
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,130
Important.

17
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:23,650
These have to follow each other and have to be of the same type so both have to be an element of type

18
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,300
S..

19
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:30,100
We couldn't use the elves if that were a death in this case you would have to set up the IF here instead

20
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,710
of using the else.

21
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,220
So does it now.

22
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:39,040
Should show the right thing and we can't check to see if we save it and reload.

23
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,110
Now the action buttons are gone.

24
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,130
We only see start new game.

25
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,400
Now of course the button doesn't do anything because we haven't talked it up but at least we are now

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,240
showing the right thing.

27
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,700
Next of course we want to hook up this button so that we can change from.

28
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,940
Well game is not running to game is running.

29
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,060
Let's do this next.

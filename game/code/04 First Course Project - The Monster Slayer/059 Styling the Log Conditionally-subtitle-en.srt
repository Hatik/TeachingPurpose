1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:09,370
I always set up some classes in DC s s file here here here I got my player turn monster current classes

2
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,170
which colored the background in different colors red and bluish.

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:20,560
Basically I want to attach these classes to my list item here by eneral.

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,300
Put this there were multiple lines so that it's easier to read.

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:34,850
So by simply adding a binding to class your with the colon at the beginning to bind tudy class property

6
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,660
class attributes to be precise.

7
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:46,880
I don't want to bind an object where I either attached a player return let's say or the Monster Tour

8
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,760
and class these are the classes set up in the C S S file and deconditioned for the player turn class

9
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,620
is in turn is player is true.

10
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:05,190
This is why I do have is is player field here which I said true for each player action and force and

11
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:11,380
you monstre a tax function and therefore the monster term should be attached.

12
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,810
If turn is player is not true.

13
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:19,200
Hence the exclamation mark with that if I save it and reload.

14
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,110
We now see we get some color coloring here get nicer styles.

15
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:30,070
And with that we get a finished application with all the functionality I wanted to have with the working

16
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:30,770
buttons.

17
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,550
Some nice styling.

18
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,490
Everything handled conditionally and dynamically by View chess.

19
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:42,160
And I hope you saw how easy it was to create this application with a view chaffs.

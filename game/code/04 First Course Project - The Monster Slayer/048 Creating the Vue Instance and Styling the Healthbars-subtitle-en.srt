1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:05,560
As I said I want to start by setting up deep layer health.

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:11,850
But the very first thing of course is that I create a new instance I can do this because of my index

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,360
age and I'm awful up here.

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,220
I'm imploding viewed from a CDN.

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:25,680
So here with this new instance I now want to control the element with the idea of app disasters.

6
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:31,260
Dave repping my whole app so that we can use this as a template.

7
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,030
And then I need to store some data in this instance.

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:42,580
For example the player health all go into name and player health and this should be 100 initially and

9
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:47,590
the same is true for the monster health let's say should also be 100.

10
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:52,450
So this is the basic data I'm managing for now.

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:01:00,070
One thing we will probably also need since we can click Start a new game is to track if a new game or

12
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,200
if a game is running or not.

13
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,160
So I will add.

14
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:11,170
Game is running here true and set it to false initially so that initially we don't have a running game

15
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:18,460
so do it by checking does property here we can see if we should display the start a new game button

16
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,580
or our action buttons like attack and heal.

17
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:29,110
Well with this data and place we can actually work on our template a little more and start displaying

18
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:36,450
the health let's say the easiest thing is dead inside of our health bars here we simply outpoured the

19
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:48,050
player health here and in the monster area we also output the monster health if y is safe days and reloaders

20
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:52,060
application we should now see the numbers inside our health bars.

21
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:59,140
That is great but I also want to just deal with that health bar of d in our health bar off this green

22
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,600
area here.

23
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:06,550
Now to justice you'll see that the health bar generally has this green background here.

24
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,560
It is nested in this outer a health class here.

25
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:16,150
And if we have a look at the C S s style we see that initially it has a wealth of 80 percent that we

26
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,160
have set up a transition that it's move fully moves when we change the width.

27
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:27,900
And now we want to change that with we want to change that with to our actual health which is 100 at

28
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,430
the beginning as we just set it up for that.

29
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:36,990
We clearly can use the style help our view chase offers us.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,120
So I'm going to restructure this a bit so that it's easier to read and hear of what to bind to the style

31
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,020
property as explained in the last lectures.

32
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:52,420
It's no issue that we have style here and now blind to it behind the scenes you chaps will merge this

33
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:59,190
to Gabr So here in binding to style and I pass a javascript objects here to describe the style I want

34
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,760
to attach I want to change the width like this.

35
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,670
And we don't have to enclose it in single quotation marks to be precise.

36
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:17,590
And I want to set the value depending on the player health here and now how should we use that if I

37
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,220
set it to 100 like this.

38
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:26,900
This would be treated as pixels but I want to set it to percentages so I will add percentage here.

39
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:34,980
This will make sure should be in single quotes though that the width of this day of year will be 100

40
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:39,170
percent and 100 percent of what of its view container.

41
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:45,370
So if the outer Def and the outer day will be days how far here.

42
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:54,390
So if we save this and reload now we see now it's the full width of that because we set it to 100 percent

43
00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:01,470
initially instead of 80 percent which we had our wise side note correctly you might say but our deaf

44
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,770
also has D.C.'s S-Class health bar and that doesn't help or is said to 80 percent with.

45
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,000
So why is it now 100 percent.

46
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:17,460
Just when we change the inner one you have to keep in mind the outer day of the great health bar we

47
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:24,720
saw before it was 80 percent of the size of d day of holding dead health bar which has this column here.

48
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,570
But now the entire health bar makes up 100 percent of the outer one.

49
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:34,680
Therefore even though the outer one doesn't completely fill the width of its holding element day distaff

50
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:39,750
the inner one now makes up the full width of the health bar and that is what we need.

51
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,340
So this is how we set this up.

52
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:50,340
Now with that I can simply copy that to my monster health bar down here where I also have the stylus

53
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,140
just wrapped together by my idea here.

54
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:59,940
And you know of course I want to use the monster health and not deep layer health with that we're putting

55
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:05,640
the health and we're adjusting the health bar is the next step is to be able to actually start a new

56
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:12,780
game and well start setting up these actions so that we can do more than just view our health and this

57
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,460
non working application.

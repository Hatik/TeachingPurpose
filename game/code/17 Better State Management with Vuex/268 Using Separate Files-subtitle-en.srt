1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:08,110
So we made our central story of chess for much slimmer by having this counter module.

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,670
I could outsource de-value related things into the volume which will then store would be really slim

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,970
but I don't want to do it because I want to show something else.

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:25,410
Sometimes you also have some stayed some action some getters which don't really belong into one module

5
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:32,040
in your application let's say you have a users part and you have your blog part and there will be two

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,280
great modules.

7
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,130
But then also you've got some state which is only displayed in the header which has to be displayed

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,790
everywhere.

9
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,540
Therefore you don't want to put the header related stayed into either of the two modules.

10
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,920
You can leave it in your main store file but maybe you've got a lot of different actions and so on.

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,870
So you store Cheese-Bob will grow pretty big again.

12
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:01,710
Well for that you can create our files like let's say action start ups not a new module's folder but

13
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,600
immediately in the store folder you can then take your actions only one action here.

14
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,040
But yeah that's it for dental purposes I guess.

15
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:18,760
And then the actions yes file you simply export a constant and give it a name update values in the name

16
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,940
of your action.

17
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,830
And then of course now is a function.

18
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,060
So turn it into a E-6 function by adding the arrow and the equal sign.

19
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,660
And if you have more actions you'll simply add more exports.

20
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,970
So here we use named exports to export all our actions.

21
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:39,750
So action number two would be a number function and for example.

22
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,740
So these are the actions we still can call commed like this because we still will get this commit or

23
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,300
this context argument here will still work as before.

24
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:57,930
So with the constant export Let's go to our restore and here we now want to import our actions fled

25
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,690
at the import from these actions file here.

26
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:07,980
And I'm not going to import all the export constants one by one even though it would only be one year

27
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:14,190
but it could be more we're a real application and still use the stars syntax and that ass actions does

28
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:22,770
name is up to you to let javascript create an object here which I can access with the name actions.

29
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:29,310
So this is an object where all my export that values here are basically just properties in that object.

30
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,940
So since actions here also is an object.

31
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,780
Well I can just use actions.

32
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,680
So my imported actions object here and that should work fine.

33
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,450
Now we can do the same for mutations.

34
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:50,160
So let me quickly add mutation mutations not just here where we also export the update value constants

35
00:02:50,160 --> 00:03:02,000
so export Konst update value and of course all is let's create a gatherer's dot chase file for my whip's

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,610
here for my Geter possibly could be more than one of course.

37
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,630
Then this would make more sense.

38
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:14,770
So let's add this getter let's add the equal sign year and then in the store.

39
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:24,760
Of course they also want to add the imports so getters and two mutations like this and then here as

40
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,380
with actions we use these imported objects and with this place if I save this.

41
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,410
You see this still works as before but now we get a very very lean file here.

42
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:45,970
We outsource both our centralized tasks and the actions getters mutations file and we have modules for

43
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,320
more specialized things.

44
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:56,560
And of course you could even split your modules into actions getters and mutations files so you could

45
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:05,400
create a counter folder and endless folder you could then have the action start js file and so on.

46
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:11,710
I'm not going to do this here but you can do this and this really allows you to split this up and to

47
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,430
keep the individual Fahd's manageable and lean.

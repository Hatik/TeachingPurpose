1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:09,920
So finally at the end of this module was quite a bit of work I guess view x is a powerful tool in large

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,310
applications but it can seem very intimidating in smaller applications.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:21,230
It's up to you to decide if it's worth the extra effort especially when diving into name spaces like

4
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,500
we did here at the end which as a side note is of course optional.

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,760
You can use X as you use to before.

6
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:34,540
So it's up to you to decide is it worth it or not in the next course module will use it in our final

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,820
course project.

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:43,490
So that will hopefully get you some more practice using it and make it easier to make this decision

9
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,170
and to see how much effort it really is in their real application.

10
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,500
So let's move onto that.

1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:10,130
Well as with getters in the last videos we could have the same problem when changing our store or changing

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:10,940
our state.

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,710
Right now we're doing this directly from the components.

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,030
We're basically accessing our state and we manipulate it there.

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:23,060
Well that can get a problem if you've got multiple components manipulating our state.

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:29,330
Then again it gets hired to track which component added to the state at which point of time and so on.

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,880
And therefore that is not really the way we want to do it especially not in bigger applications.

8
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:41,840
So a better way is to use a similar concept as with Gabbers But now for its setting to store that could

9
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:48,500
think it's called setter's but it's actually called mutations because it mutates to store it or the

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,010
state should say it changes the state.

11
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,540
These mutations are committed.

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:01:01,150
So we basically commit such a mutation from one point in our application or from one component maybe.

13
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:07,520
And then this will update the state and all the components listening getters will automatically receive

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,750
the updated state.

15
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,310
Let's see this in action and let's see how we can add such mutations.

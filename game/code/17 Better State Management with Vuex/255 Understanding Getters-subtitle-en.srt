For debt problem I just described the last video where we do have more complex calculations when fetching

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:13,700
our state and possibly do we have this in multiple parts of her application for this problem.

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:19,400
We do have a solution instead of directly accessing our state in a computer and where we want to access

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,040
it.

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:27,870
We can create a Gedor such a getter would then get the state from the store and perform any calculations

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,220
that should perform.

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,260
But then we X-ists does getter from our different components.

8
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:40,220
Hence our calculation our code is stored in one place and then we only reach out to that Geter from

9
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,750
the pieces in our application where we want to reach and let's have a look at how we could implement

10
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,400
this in the next video.

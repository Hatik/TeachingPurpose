1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,780
So we get the basics about using eggs.

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:10,540
Let's now have a look at how we could structure all our view X-related code namely the code in the store

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,170
the chairs fall with different thoughts.

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:18,350
Something we want to do for bigger applications because if have all the state getters mutations and

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,750
actions in one file.

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:26,170
This fall will quickly croak pretty big and that's something we do not necessarily want.

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,190
Important in the end of this module you'll find a lecturer or an article where I will link to fubar

8
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,860
resources and also discuss an alternative set up.

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,850
Q Which to the one I show you here.

10
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:44,190
The one to show you here is the one you will see in almost all official examples and so on.

11
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,200
So that is why I chose this one.

12
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:54,740
So for this example the first one to use something called modules are the modules folder and in the

13
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,930
next video I will explain what modules actually are.

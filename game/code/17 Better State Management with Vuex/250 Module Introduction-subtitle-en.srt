1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:08,320
All almost Then we learn a lot about the chase for this course a lot about its basics.

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:13,570
It's Centex it's a search and two different pieces or different features.

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:21,250
It offers us now and the last March when we had a look at routeing we really made a major step towards

4
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:27,280
building large applications with view chairs or single page applications to begin with but that also

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,640
tend to be Robert big applications.

6
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:37,300
Now if we talk about bigger applications there's one additional thing we haven't discussed yet that

7
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,730
is a better way of State Management.

8
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:46,300
We touched on state management and other modules when we used custom events to pass data from a child

9
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:52,680
to a parent could a component or props to do it the other way or when we use the event bus in this module.

10
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:58,600
We'll learn about yet the number possibility of managing our state one which is especially suited for

11
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:04,410
bigger applications where all the other ways will give you some problems sooner or later.

12
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:10,150
So let's have a look at this pattern or this state management system which is called view x.

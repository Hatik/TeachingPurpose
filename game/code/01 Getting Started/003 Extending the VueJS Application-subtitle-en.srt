1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:07,530
Now in the last lecture we already create our first view application and got started with it.

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,860
Now let's enhance it a little bit more before I.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,410
Then of course dive much deeper into it in the next course sections.

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,790
So what I want to do right now though is I want to add an input field.

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:24,150
I can do this by typing input and hitting tab which will give me that and cheers for Will and now this

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:29,740
input here I want to allow the user to type something there and update my title depending on what the

7
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:30,880
user enters.

8
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:37,810
Well I can do this by adding a command to the input field instruction view chiasm will recognize this

9
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,690
is called a directive.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:45,970
The directive and Eolas V dash on and does as just set a special command view class will recognize.

11
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,300
Keep in mind this whole part is under control of you.

12
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:55,170
And then the thing does the on command tells of Mujeres is.

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,470
Please listen to some event know which you went.

14
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,330
I passed this as an argument and arguments are passed to directives by adding a colon and then the name

15
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,000
of the argument.

16
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:09,790
In this case the name of the event I want to listen to it's the input event which is fired on every

17
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,880
keystroke.

18
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:17,260
And then I assign a value to this and between the quotation marks I would now write the code which I

19
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,550
want to execute.

20
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,770
When ever this gets updated.

21
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:26,720
So a year what I want to do is I want to call a method and calling a method is very simple.

22
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,450
I can simply call change title here.

23
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,420
Now of course this method doesn't exist yet.

24
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,780
So that's created creating Navitas as simple as data.

25
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,990
Beauty has also got a reserved property in the view instance which is called methods and the worries

26
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:46,630
you will learn about all these reserved property names and how the word for the course method is again

27
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,610
an object.

28
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:53,350
And here we simply set up all the methods we want to use either in our template work from within our

29
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,620
view instance.

30
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,810
So here I named it change tile up there.

31
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,500
So let's name it.

32
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,300
Change Heiliger here to does as a function there for.

33
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,040
And now in this function I want to change my title.

34
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,870
And here's the first important thing.

35
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,240
I won't say that.

36
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,720
Tile or something like that.

37
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,980
Instead I can say this title equals.

38
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:19,280
Now this referring to the data object certainly looks a bit strange and it is strange.

39
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:26,500
It's some magic being done in the background by you chase it proxies all our data properties like title

40
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,740
to the top view instance object automatically.

41
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,820
Which is why we can access it with this.

42
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:36,520
I will come back to this later in the course but for now it's just important to keep in mind you got

43
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:42,880
access to all the properties stored in data and also to all the methods stored and methods by accessing

44
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,030
them with this.

45
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,960
And then the name.

46
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:51,010
So this title gives me access to the title stored here and now I want to assign you value to user entered

47
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,150
into the input.

48
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:58,870
Well thankfully as with that knowledge javascript there is this event object being created automatically

49
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,390
for me.

50
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:04,230
This has nothing to do with view taste is as vanilla javascript and how that Dom works.

51
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:09,790
I get this event object which for example all the stores target the event which of course will be this

52
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,380
input field.

53
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:18,340
Now this event object which is created automatically by chala script is passed to this method automatically

54
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,600
by the U.K.'s.

55
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,180
So I can fetch it because I know it will receive an argument and I'll name it event does against a default

56
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,730
event object created by javascript.

57
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:34,210
Now you can simply say and I know that the Stevel object has a target property and I know that the target

58
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:39,700
will be the input field of which I know it will have a value property holding the value the user entered.

59
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,790
Well and with this emplace That's all if we now control enter again we see this input and if we type

60
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,910
something there we see that it updates our title.

61
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,340
This is awesome I'd say.

62
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:55,150
Our first duty as application and we bolted in like eight minutes.

63
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,320
Really awesome.

64
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:02,380
So with that let's see how you can work your way through discours what this course has to offer how

65
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,860
you could set up the same example locally on your machine.

66
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,870
Before we Denne dive super deep into view chairs and the next lectures.

1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,590
Welcome to this course I'm really happy to have you here because I view chess as an amazing powerful

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,720
and really fun to work with Front-End framework.

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:17,430
Let's get started right away and dive into the first important question what is Mujeres or why would

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,210
you want to use it.

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,710
How does it help you.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:26,670
Well viewed as allows you to create everything from small which it's driven by javascript which you

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,410
drop into existing applications like this one which will create and this course where we simply replace

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:37,140
some content dynamically and play a nice animation with it over medium sized applications where you

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,460
control the whole page.

10
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:44,120
Foochow a script and therefore we render various parts making it very reactive like this one.

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:51,540
And of course project all the way up to building big enterprise level applications single page applications

12
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:58,800
where your whole web page multiple pages listed views like this to the user are driven by butis which

13
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:04,600
renders significant parts of the dorms to make it look like there were different pages being loaded.

14
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:11,180
But in the end javascript handling all of that why javascript because javascript runs in the browser

15
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,150
you don't need to reach out to any server.

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,310
You don't need to wait for any responses if you only want to Re-Read or Pardes up the application.

17
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,960
This makes the application very reactive it makes it feel nice and it provides awesome user experiences.

18
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,250
Now that is what you can do with huge yes.

19
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:32,600
Now why would you choose View chairs and not let's say a single or two or reactor's which you might

20
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,740
know which do a similar thing.

21
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:41,810
Well first of all beauty is extremely lean and small regarding the file size we're talking about 16

22
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,690
kilobytes many cheese.

23
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,640
For the core framework.

24
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,080
Now I will say that is without the router for example which you would have to add extra But even with

25
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,240
that it still stays very lean and small.

26
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,170
It's a very focused and to the point framework but it's not only small.

27
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,630
Providing a fast loading time.

28
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:08,540
It also is fast at runtime and telling with some benchmarks it even beats angular to and react to yes.

29
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:14,210
Now of course that will always depend on your specific application but what we can say is it is extremely

30
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:20,360
fast edge runtime Hence really again adding to this very great reactive user experience.

31
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,330
Now you would probably assume that a small and fast framework doesn't have that many features but you

32
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,080
would be wrong.

33
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,390
It's very feature rich and throughout the course we will go through all the features and you will learn

34
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,240
how they work how you use them when you use them.

35
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,310
What's the idea behind them as you will or in the future has this very extendible for example with the

36
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,150
extra router.

37
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:46,220
But then this extension then also fits nicely into the core framework.

38
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,160
And again we will walk through all these great features for all the scores.

39
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:57,690
Now with that first impression I'd say let's dive right into it and get started.

40
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:03,970
View chess and build our first application as well as see how we actually get set up spoiler.

41
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,210
It's very easy to do.

42
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,660
Let's do it in the next lecture.

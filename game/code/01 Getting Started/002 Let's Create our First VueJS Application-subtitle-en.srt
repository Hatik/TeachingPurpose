1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,990
Getting started with the beauty and creating your first application is actually very simple.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,310
We start on the future as Todd or it gets official home page and there you see this nice get started

3
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:17,560
button let's click on it it takes you to the official documentation which is always worth having a look

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,130
anyways.

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,910
But there we want to go to installation.

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,660
Now here you've got a couple of different options depending on which kind of setup you want to use later

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,960
and of course we'll use a more complex set up using weapons to bundle all our files.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,750
But let's start with a simple one.

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,050
You could either simply download your chest.

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,590
I will show this in the later video or as I want it now.

11
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,440
Simply grab it from a CD.

12
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,650
So imported from another server.

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,100
Here I'll take the first one and then simply copy this whole link.

14
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:52,350
Now if dad can import this link to get access to UK as well I want to do this year on chess.

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:59,050
We're just kind of a Web editor you could say for a very simple javascript AGM L and C S S only projects.

16
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:03,780
Here we got our HDMI out section and what we should add a script import.

17
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:10,110
So lets add script and then by hitting tab it will automatically expanded to script text there.

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,680
I want to add my source attribute and now insert tooling could just copy it.

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,340
Now you can leave the link like this or you can remove as world number two always automatically fetched

20
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,560
the latest version.

21
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,180
With that we imported huge S And We can now already use it and all its features.

22
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,220
So let's use it and bolt our first little application for dat.

23
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,390
I want to add a paragraph in which I want to say hello world.

24
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,200
Now saying it like this clearly is not very interesting.

25
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,930
There is no javascript involved at any place.

26
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:46,280
Instead I want to output this fruit view as now in order to do so.

27
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:53,970
I will simply go to each script section here and use the word up there to now use one of the major objects

28
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,350
does.

29
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,680
Import this view Chez framework gives me the view object.

30
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:04,050
Let's create a new instance based on that with the new keyword and then view.

31
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:13,000
This gives us a new view instance and view instances created like this are the core of each view application

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,510
of each piece of code.

33
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:22,750
You want to use Mujeres and you create such instances and then these instances have one major job control

34
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,610
their own template of code of HVM all code which they render to the screen.

35
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:34,920
Now in order to will let you instance do this we have to pass an argument to the constructor function.

36
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,910
The argument is a challenge to an object and then we have one very important property beauteous will

37
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,820
recognize the L property.

38
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,940
This is kind of a research property obviously.

39
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,080
You chaps will recognize it and l takes a string as a value.

40
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,610
And with this string we set up.

41
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:57,930
Which part of our HVM our code here should be under control of this view instance.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,920
Under control.

43
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,910
I mean we can then change it frood this view instance you will see this in a few seconds.

44
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:10,060
So here I want to control this part but I want to wrap it in a day of let's say a day which encloses

45
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:17,380
my template for this view instance 0 at a div and the hash tag app and then tab automatically gives

46
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,060
me a div with the idea.

47
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:25,100
Now insert my paragraph inside of the Stiv and then I can select this Dave with the idea.

48
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,760
By using a string like s.c.s as selector.

49
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:34,720
So with hash tag app I select the element with the idea with dot app I would select the first element

50
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,460
with a class of app..

51
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,660
Now here I therefore have no control of this day.

52
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,210
It is not a template of this view instance.

53
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,250
And now in order to output something we need some data.

54
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,220
Well Beauty has got a special property for this.

55
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:54,580
The data property and number research property and now this isn't a string it's an object instead and

56
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,020
in there we store all the data we want to use.

57
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,550
In this view instance.

58
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,090
So let's say we want to have a title and his name is totally up to you.

59
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,480
Where I say hello world.

60
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,760
Now is the time I want to output in my template and before I hardcoded it in here.

61
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:15,840
Now with this template being under control of Eugenius It's as simple as using this special syntax view

62
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:21,880
Chase will recognize with double curly braces opening and closing and in between I can simply write.

63
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,950
Title and as will automatically look into the state object.

64
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,050
As I said this is a reserved word.

65
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,000
Look into this object find the title property and output it here.

66
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:38,350
If we now had control enter chase fiddle to see the result we see Hello world on the right because now

67
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,880
we're outputting this title through view chase which now controls this template.

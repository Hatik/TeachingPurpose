1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:08,150
So we built our first application and hopefully you saw how easy it is to get started with U-2s.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,650
This is where we are at now and of course we're getting started but we'll leave there soon and thereafter

3
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:19,070
we start diving super deep into it starting with how we can interact with the DOM how we can output

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,410
data which different ways we have how we can bind to HDMI attributes how we can listen to events and

5
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,720
much much more.

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,780
These are actually multiple molecules in this course and you will get a very first great impression

7
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,100
or understanding of how Mujeres works.

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,310
Well thereafter it's time to deeply dive into the view.

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,720
Instead it's this core object.

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:47,350
Each view application in the end or which or whatever you're creating uses.

11
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,110
How does it work which lifecycle does it follow.

12
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,420
How can you use it to your advantage.

13
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,050
Well then it's time to leave.

14
00:00:54,070 --> 00:01:00,320
Chase fil-A which will use for the first sections and really learn about how you could set up more professional

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,050
workflows will use the views sealife or that.

16
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,780
But that really isn't that Ziel doing all the work.

17
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:12,350
It's just a Selye which provides some ease to use and quickly to get started with templates for example

18
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,910
then using web peg in the end.

19
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:19,980
We will talk in greater detail about this in the section of course with the more professional workflow

20
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,300
set up we can dive into components.

21
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,270
A key concept up us.

22
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:31,640
You build up your application from components you can create reusable parts containing a template and

23
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,350
business logic which you can use in different places in Europe really powerful.

24
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:42,230
And I will actually have multiple modules here about basics about how you can communicate between components

25
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,540
and some advanced concepts.

26
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:51,530
Well with all these core features being set we will then have a look at forums how can we handle user

27
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:57,830
input how can we use different form elements and how can we create our own form control thereafter we'll

28
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,300
have a look at directives folders and make sense.

29
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,780
What are all these things.

30
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,080
How can they help you.

31
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,580
How would you use them in your application.

32
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,120
Well we're getting really advanced here.

33
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,200
And then we're going to have a look at animations and transitions.

34
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,370
You want to make your application beautiful and you will learn how you chase makes that's very easy

35
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:23,090
how it supports us any mating dynamic content or switching from one component to another.

36
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:27,350
Well with that we're really diving super deep into it.

37
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,940
But until now we always stayed in our view JSA application.

38
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,870
What if we need to reach out to a server to store something in a database.

39
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:41,030
Well we can't do that and we will learn how we can access the HTP from within a beauteous application

40
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,160
in this part of the course.

41
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,470
They are after time to have a look at what you would need to create bigger applications namely single

42
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,970
page applications.

43
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,160
For that we will need routing.

44
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,840
And of course they have a whole module dedicated to word where you will learn how the router works how

45
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:03,230
to set it up how to use child Rodd's how to pass parameters and much more that belongs in a world of

46
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:09,590
single page applications and kind of like so does the state management will have a look at then managing

47
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,620
the state and more complex applications can quickly become a problem as you will see there.

48
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:20,390
And I will also provide a solution view x a great additional package which makes this easy.

49
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:25,070
That concludes the single page application part and will then have a look at deployment.

50
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,640
How can we actually ship our application to a server.

51
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,670
Does this sound right to me.

52
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,660
It does and I can't wait to dive deeper into that adduces soon.

53
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:39,350
Let's next have a look at which resources this course gives you to make your progress.

54
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,580
Besides watching these videos as easy as possible.

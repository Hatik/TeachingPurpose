1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:07,030
In your first course section here I will use chess fiddle because it allows me to really focus on the

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:12,010
core things I want to bring to you and allows you to easily follow along.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:18,020
Now maybe you don't want to use it or you want to use a local set up right from the beginning.

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,950
Well we will have a look at the real work flow later in the course.

5
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:27,460
But if you want to start locally that is of course possible you simply head to the installation page

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,720
of beauteous.

7
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,410
And there you can also download Mujeres to use it locally.

8
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:37,450
Now for a production ready you would of course choose the production Worthen but for development you

9
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,940
should use the development version which gives you some extra warnings and errors.

10
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:47,130
While you can simply download this and store it in some folder I prepared this uder Acharyas file and

11
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,080
with that you got your files stored here.

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,530
Then you want to open up your favorite editor could be sublime could be Adam.

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,990
You will find a list of some example editors in the last lecture of this module and there you probably

14
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,920
want to set up your favorite.

15
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,530
Or like your favorite by default HDMI 5 skeleton like this.

16
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:11,890
And then of course we have to go to Chase fiddle copy all the HD female killed and pasted in the body

17
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,040
section.

18
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,870
We can remove the script import.

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,590
We will use our local file if we're dead.

20
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,370
So let's add a script import and he had S..

21
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,760
Whoops I need a source of course pointing to the view that js file.

22
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:30,030
And we also need our script down here so let's copy that to and then add a script tag below our death

23
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,210
def remove the source here at this end with that if you now saved us.

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,300
Let's say as index HVM all in the same folder as the view that yes file lives.

25
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,330
You can simply double click on it when viewed in the browser here.

26
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,700
And of course here if you type something it should work as it shares fiddle and this is how you could

27
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,220
follow along locally.

28
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:56,260
Again a more complex were the will be set up later but with Dad you can get started and I'd say let's

29
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,850
now start diving deeper into view as in the next course module.

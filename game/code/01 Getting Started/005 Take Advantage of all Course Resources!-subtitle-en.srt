1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:08,440
Froths course you get a lot of videos where I will explain all the concepts in detail but sometimes

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,820
you need a bit more than that.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,570
You don't only want to watch me code.

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,030
You want to code yourself.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:19,000
Well it's for that reason that we will build for projects for all the course practicing the different

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,200
concepts we all learn.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,870
So they are scattered out from the cores and we will well finally conclude this course with Boling our

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:30,100
final project which is a complete single page application in the end.

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:37,090
But besides these projects I also got a lot of quicker exercises mixed in so little exercises where

10
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:42,320
you practice single key concepts of that module the exercises place then.

11
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:48,220
So together with the projects and the exercises usually have a lot of coding challenges for the course

12
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:54,840
which allow you to practice the things you will see in the videos on your own.

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,620
But besides that of course you can all find all the source code attached to the last lecture in each

14
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,240
module.

15
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:05,070
So if you want to have a look at the code we worked through in the video to get over that is where we

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,500
you would go to see it in action.

17
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:14,050
Well and finally there's always the Q&amp;A section where you can and should ask questions if you were in

18
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,420
doubt about something.

19
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:21,730
Now there are a lot of students and myself helping you there and replying to your questions but always

20
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:28,090
keep in mind asking questions is great but also consider answering the questions of our students.

21
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:33,400
This really is how you'll learn the most because you really have to challenge the things you've learned

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,150
and reiterate them in such a case.

23
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,790
So I strongly recommend answering questions too.

24
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,660
This will give you the most.

25
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,330
Well and with that I'd say let's have a look at how we could set up this project locally if you don't

26
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:50,370
want to use chairs fiddle in the first course much saltier and thereafter.

27
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,600
Time to get started and I've super deep interview Chaz.

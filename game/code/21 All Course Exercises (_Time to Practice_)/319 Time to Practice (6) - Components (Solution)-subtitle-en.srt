1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,250
Were successful Here's my solution.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:11,730
As you can see my app we've got a lot leaner and I got four new files folder headers server details

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,590
and servers to view.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,860
I'm importing all these files here in my app file and then on in years I'm exporting a default object

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,320
where it is set up my components.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,090
So I'm registering it locally.

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:29,570
Again it would have been perfectly fine if you were to use view component and registered them globally

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:35,320
but I just choose the local registration as I'm only using them in the app view file here anyways.

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,510
I set up my selector this year as keys in this property or in this object.

10
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,970
And then I assigned the imported objects as values.

11
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:49,100
This is my set up here now in my component's year.

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:56,280
I basically only export these rows and columns and then the content from the well-meanin fall we used

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,080
before I did the header and footer.

14
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:06,640
Now for the servers I only imported the column because I wanted to keep the row here in my app you fall.

15
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,020
Since I group servers and service detail to Gebert in one row.

16
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,290
So I wanted to keep the row in this main component in the main file here.

17
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:21,490
Therefore servers and server details only have the column in their template.

18
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,930
And regarding the servers it would have theoretically made sense to also make the individual server

19
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,420
its own component.

20
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,100
So do you list them here to have a separate component for that.

21
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,270
But we would have a problem with passing the current index down to this individual component.

22
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:46,080
We could loop through all the service we did that before but then it's kind of hard to adjust the number

23
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,380
of the server in this server itself.

24
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,910
So we will learn how to pass data from a parent to a child component in the next module.

25
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:02,070
Until then I'll stick to this solution and this really is it now in the next years I want to go into

26
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:09,030
some possible improvements regarding the file structure and how you pick the right names for your selectors

27
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,440
as we do here.

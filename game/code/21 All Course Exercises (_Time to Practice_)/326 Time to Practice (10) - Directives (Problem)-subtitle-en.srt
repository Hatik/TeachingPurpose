1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:08,750
So let's use our newly gained directive knowledge and put it into practice by building yet another custom

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,280
directive.

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,650
But now it's your turn.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,310
What one should it build.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,600
I wanted to build a custom directive which works like V on.

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,460
Basically without all its modifiers and so on.

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:26,870
But I want you to build a directive which you can attach like we my on whatever you want to use as a

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,360
name and there are no modifiers and anything like that.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,480
But now just the argument being the went like clock and then between the quotation marks some code you

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,330
want to execute now to make it a little bit easier.

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,820
But we need quotation marks here.

12
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,260
We only want X sect functions we didn't execute.

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,900
Now that might sound super complicated but I promise you it isn't.

14
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,510
It's an ice challenge though.

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,910
So good luck with that.

16
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,280
I'll see you in the next video where we solve this too Gebre.

1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,150
Let's practice using our templates and text you upload some data.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,990
Here are some exercises I prepared.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,710
I'll quickly walk you through them and then in the next video we will find a solution for that.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:18,210
The first task should be robbers simple but it's important to get these core mechanics right here.

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,340
I want you to output your name and your age.

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,150
Both should be stored in properties in the data property down here.

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,040
I already created the name field.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,400
Well you should probably add a H field.

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,210
And of course replace your name and your age with your real name and age.

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:40,180
If you want to then output them appear in this paragraph maybe using strict interpolation you will figure

11
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,920
it out in the second exercise.

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,370
We want to have a little Chalis code expression in the installation syntax so what we need is call the

13
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:54,380
braces try to output your age multiplied by free here.

14
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,920
The first exercise then also stays in this corner.

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,090
But here I want to call a function somehow and output the result of this function here.

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:10,180
These functions should give you a random number between 0 and 1 bonus exercise which has nothing to

17
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,980
do with huge though change is to output a random number between 1 and 100.

18
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:22,480
If you want to practice some math and general Chalis skills for search and image and Google and then

19
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:30,640
make this image tag here display that image of course not by simply adding dealing here in the in the

20
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,060
source attribute but in step by storing the link in a property in your data which you Dansk somehow

21
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,070
bind to the source attribute here.

22
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:44,830
The last exercise is to populate this input field with your name.

23
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:51,160
We already do have this property down there and therefore make this input field show your name by default.

24
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,600
These are the tasks I wish you good luck with that and I'll see you in the next video to solve these

25
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,240
two GABR.

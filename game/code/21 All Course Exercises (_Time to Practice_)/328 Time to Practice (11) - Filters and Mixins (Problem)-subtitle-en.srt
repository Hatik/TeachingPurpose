1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:07,150
So now that we learned a lot about falters and makes ends it's time to practice it.

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,580
For little exercises for you and the first exercise.

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:18,550
I want you to build your local field or your own local folder which resists any text 8 folders in a

4
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,620
second exercise.

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:25,360
I want you to build a global filter which then counts the length of the word and ended up hands it to

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,900
the end of it like this you have a paragraph where you output test.

7
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,030
Let's say then I want to filter it.

8
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:37,950
So task gets transformed to test whitespace and in parentheses the length of this word in exercise number

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,060
three I want you to repeat exercises 1 and 2.

10
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:47,080
But now with computer properties so that you see how you can also solve that with our folders and exercise

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,350
number four I want you to share the computed property you build for exercise 2.

12
00:00:52,660 --> 00:01:00,070
So the global filter which now is a computer propertied you to exercise free to share it via a mix and

13
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,600
well with that.

14
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,100
I wish you good luck with that.

15
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,170
See you on the next video where I will show you my solution.

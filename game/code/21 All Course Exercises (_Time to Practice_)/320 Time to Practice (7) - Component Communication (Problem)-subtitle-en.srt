1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:09,520
Time to practice the things we learned here and back in the exercise we did before where we outsourced

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,850
all the different pieces into components.

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,660
Until now we're not able to have them talk to each other.

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,220
Time to change this.

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:25,900
What I want to achieve now or what I want you to achieve is dead in my server's component here.

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:32,560
We get a separate component for each list item and we'll loop through all these separate components.

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:38,140
We don't carry it with me for a loop and passed the current index so the current server number to stay

8
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,090
in this world.

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,550
Tudor's server.

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,160
Well let's make it a bit more complicated.

11
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:50,020
Actually let's create an array of server objects here in the service you instance we have to create

12
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:56,740
in the script text therefore remember that data should be a function when having a single file template

13
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:06,560
is like this and then pastie the idea of each server which is set in this object to each component here

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,430
which holds a list item and then when you click Search the server here I want to load it in the server

15
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:20,440
details component where we have a button to switch the server status which should also be managed in

16
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,220
the data property of the service that you file.

17
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:31,450
Now I will start by setting up this object holding all the servers and they are after.

18
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,190
I would recommend going on on your own.

19
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:41,270
I'm just doing this as some starting help so that you don't accidentally run into problems just because

20
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,110
I maybe did not clearly say what the idea is.

21
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:52,280
So here we have in the service view file a default object with some data.

22
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:58,930
Remember data shall be a function returning an object which then actually holds our data.

23
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:08,420
And then I want to have a service property in this instance available there for it and service should

24
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:19,070
be an array of multiple javascript objects where each object has let's say the ideal server ID that

25
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:26,870
could be a number one for example and then a status let's say normal for the first one and then I'll

26
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,750
repeat this three times.

27
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,760
So I have two IDs one to four and I have critical.

28
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,450
I have known and I have normal again just an example.

29
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,770
And then this is where you take over.

30
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:47,630
I want you to loop through all these servers create a new component for a list item pass the ID and

31
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:54,410
the status to that be able to click daz component and then load the server and server detects where

32
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,460
we have a button to change the status back to normal.

33
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,080
That's the exercise.

34
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,150
Let's see how it use all that.

35
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,190
I will show you my solution in the next video.

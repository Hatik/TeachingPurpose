1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:08,510
Get started with the first exercise year of course we want to execute a function here so I will add

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:15,270
DV underactive to listen to you a user event for iste I then pass the argument of the colon which is

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,100
the name of the year when I want to listen to you.

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,450
And that's the click event here now.

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,660
But do we need quotation marks.

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,560
I specified a code to execute on each click and here as us just set a one to execute a function.

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,930
So down there I'll edit my methods and I will name and alert me just like that.

8
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:40,080
Now in this function all I'll do is I will throw an alert where I say Alert really straight forward.

9
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,640
And now it can use to alert me function from down there to pass a served ball reference here in the

10
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,660
quotation marks as de-value for this directive binding.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,880
If I now had control enter and click on Show alert we see just alert over here.

12
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:03,180
So this is now working this is the first task and the second one I now want to listen to a different

13
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,910
he went on a different element on this input here the user is of course able to type something here

14
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,010
and I want to listen to each keystroke the user does.

15
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:17,790
So again with we on that can set up such a listener I can bind a vent to some code I want to execute

16
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:23,670
when the event occurs and the way I want to listen to is key down I could also use key up key downness

17
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,130
as the name implies fired whatever keys pressed the for the just released key up would be pressed after

18
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,060
it is released.

19
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,870
Choose whatever suits your needs here I'll choose key down and in there I want to change the value.

20
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,250
Notice initially it's set to an empty string.

21
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:49,860
I can update it by simply saying value equals and then event dollar aside even to be precise because

22
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,410
disasters are served.

23
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:58,410
Name you chase creates for us this reserved variable which stores the default event object automatically

24
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:04,290
created for us by javascript which holds valuable information like the target of the event.

25
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,510
Now the target clearly is this input field and since the input field has a value property.

26
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:12,480
This is where I can get the input value from.

27
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,680
So on my U-bend object I can access the target of the event again the input element here and then the

28
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,380
value.

29
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:26,280
And with that I'm assigning the value of the target of this event to this value property down there.

30
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,260
I could have of course all that called a function where I passed Thaller aside event as an argument

31
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,450
and use it in the function body to do to say.

32
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,860
Now add control enter let's output something here.

33
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:44,370
As you can see the value gets updated below both inputs because this is where I outputted with stinging.

34
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,310
And this is the behavior I was looking for here in the third exercise.

35
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:55,240
I want to take the second one and adjusted to only fire if the keyboard press is entered.

36
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:00,750
So I still want to be able to enter something you're not restricting this to enter but I only want to

37
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:08,110
update de-value which will then be output y is triggered appellation whenever we hit the enter key so

38
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,610
that we don't update it up on every keystroke.

39
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,500
We listen for every keystroke but we then decide should we do something or should we do something.

40
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:23,390
So in order to do this I will generally copy the same code up here as we want the same functionality

41
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,470
but of course that won't restricted to the entry key.

42
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,600
I can restrict it by adding a key modifier here with the dot.

43
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,010
I add such a modifier and then the name for the enter key simply is enter.

44
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:42,250
This tells of Mujeres only fired fire code or execute the code between quotation marks.

45
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:48,990
If we have a key down event and b very important decie which is down is the enter key.

46
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:55,630
With that if I had control enter you can see on the upper input where I don't have to check I can still

47
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:01,690
type and see the values reflected but down there we don't see an updating but as soon as it hit enter

48
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,930
it changes to Max and Maximilien and so on.

49
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:11,500
This is of course a very useful behavior because oftentimes you want to listen to every keystroke but

50
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,950
not update the value up on every keystroke.

51
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:19,090
You only want to update it once the user kind of hits enter to tell you well and then editing it take

52
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:19,760
the value.

53
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,680
For example this word that free exercise is an event.

54
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:31,540
Again very concise but should get you really started with it showing you how to listen to events with

55
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,550
the under active how to call functions how to use the event object.

56
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:43,510
Again you would have been able to pass this to a function as an argument and then how to use modifiers

57
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:50,440
like the key modifier here to control Vence specifically your event ochreous with that.

58
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,180
Let's move on to the next lectures.

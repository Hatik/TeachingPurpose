1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:07,830
Let's start with the first exercise starting the effect and then alternating between highlight and shrink

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,370
on this first day of year.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,530
I already get the START effect method here.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:22,440
So here I need to use said intro well to well switch between these two classes in order to attach to

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,180
classes.

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:32,040
I also need some property in the data property here to which I can bind the class attribute all name

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:39,940
and effect classes and that's just one possible set up here where I use an object which I want to attach.

8
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,420
You could also simply store true or false here so yeah.

9
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,110
Effect classes might be just Sure.

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,870
False and then set up this Optik up here in your HTL all killed.

11
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,210
Both will work as you learn.

12
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,660
And the last lecture is so here in this object.

13
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:02,070
I basically want to have my highlight class and this shell be attached or not.

14
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:09,090
So initially I'll say well not attach it anti-JWs shrink class which initially should be attached for

15
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,630
example up here onli did.

16
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:21,610
I can now bind today's class property by using the bind and then class.

17
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:29,190
And here I will refer to effect classes so to this property I just created if an out control enter.

18
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:35,500
Well we see it has felt great but hasn't really shrunken and to force it to shrink.

19
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:44,370
Let's add important here after that with just like that if that is missing in your code you copied it

20
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,420
should be there though.

21
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:51,970
So now you see it shrunk now to make it alternate up one set interval when hitting the Starratt effect

22
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,920
button.

23
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,680
I will at set up set interval here and I want to alternate every second.

24
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,920
So I set this to 1000 and then the function I'll execute every one second.

25
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,510
Now in this function here I will need access to my view instance.

26
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,120
Therefore I need to buy into to a new variable.

27
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,450
So this is bound to be good access to my properties on the M here.

28
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,150
I can then said we.

29
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,290
And then here.

30
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:31,160
Effect classes highlight equal to the opposite end and I'll say this right away there will be other

31
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,590
ways of controlling this of course.

32
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,850
Feel free to come up with any other way.

33
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,510
I'm going to choose a very explicit one here.

34
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:44,330
And of course I want to do the same for my shrink class here.

35
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:50,230
So let's copy that to if an out control enter and click Start effect.

36
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:57,030
We see that every second this jumps around so it changes the style because it is what I set it up to.

37
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,210
I'm alternating between these two classes.

38
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:06,220
I'm the worst thing you value of true or false you are in effect classes property every one second thus

39
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:13,270
changing the style applied to this class time for exercise number to create a couple of C S classes

40
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,960
and attach them.

41
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,680
Why are the syntax to decide and styled death here.

42
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,510
Well let's quickly do this.

43
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,180
I'll add here.

44
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:27,910
A class let's say blue and I want to set the background color to blue here.

45
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,970
Next I will have set is to float.

46
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:39,440
I will create a new class float where it is set up float right.

47
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:53,020
And lastly I will set up text color with a dash where I will simply set color to yellow let's say with

48
00:03:53,370 --> 00:04:00,020
that set up I can now go to listeth use the bind again to bind to my class and now I want to use an

49
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,680
array to attach all these different sizes as classes here.

50
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,250
Now I can now order to do that.

51
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,290
I first did you create some properties of holding links or holding the names of these classes.

52
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:19,430
Of course to be straight this of course is a much longer and complicated way than just using normal

53
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,700
class attribute and saying float text color and so on.

54
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,340
But the sense of this exercise of course is to understand how to use this syntax.

55
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:39,310
So here in my data property I will then create float and set as equal to float as a string referring

56
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,500
to this class.

57
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,510
And then I can use floats in here.

58
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:47,810
I also don't have to treat a property for each seeis as class here.

59
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:56,830
I can also enclose them in single quotes blue and text color because that is what float here will also

60
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,970
resolve to the end.

61
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,620
A single quoted CSSA name.

62
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,790
So if I now had control ENTRAR we see if floats in the right.

63
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,850
It is yellow and it has a blue background.

64
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:12,220
It doesn't look particularly pretty but our styles are applied successfully using this airy syntax thus

65
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,640
allowing us to flexibly add multiple classes and lectures on the Re.

66
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:22,880
We want to let the user enter a class and attach it what we already get a couple of classes which are

67
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,130
attached to this day of year.

68
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:36,670
So in order to see it though I will add a new one which I will set to wearable and this schelde simply

69
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:45,640
be well or add a width of 100 pixel anda height of 50 pixels so that we can always see this death.

70
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:54,430
I can then use the veep line here to bind to my class and now to show yet a novel way of adding this

71
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,480
I will use the inline syntax.

72
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,360
Writing it here in the HVM own code I could outsourced as a separate property in the data property as

73
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:08,400
well like we did here for effect classes and here I will always attach was able to Glazzard just created

74
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,900
so that we could see that.

75
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:17,250
And then I want to let the user attach another class D user attach class will be stored in that property

76
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,540
your all name and user class.

77
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,890
Initially it's empty and I can bind to this property using coupe binding with the model here.

78
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:32,740
This will make sure that whatever the user inputs gets bound to this user class property here and now

79
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,880
I want to use this user class property here in my set up in this def Sarette.

80
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:45,610
Now I'm attaching Wizard all true and now I can fix this or it can use the array syntax and makes this

81
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:52,540
class here which is always attached so I could have of course all the just written string visible but

82
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:58,480
just again what you showed it the possibilities because maybe we had some code which conditionally change

83
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,540
is true or false here.

84
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:07,720
But now I want to also bind my user class here and this will just be a string which represents a class

85
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,020
name.

86
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,190
Keep this in mind.

87
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:15,970
So if I now control enter we kind of see the diff here but we really only see it once and for blue here.

88
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,370
We can also know enter float to also float it.

89
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:24,280
So this is all possible we can kind of change our classes here separated with a whitespace of course

90
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,420
so that it really is different classes.

91
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:36,970
And yet this is how we can reactively or flexibly set that class doesn't have to be changed by user

92
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,400
input.

93
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,010
Does this chest.

94
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,670
Easiest source to simulate.

95
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:46,940
There could be any source changing user class here though and mixing it with the syntax with this average

96
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:52,840
way of adding a class with key value pairs where the keys have a class name or gives you the class name

97
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:59,160
and the value indicates whether this class should be attached or not stored as an object directly inline

98
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,730
in the HTML code there.

99
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,490
An exercise number four I want to pick up on that.

100
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:10,660
But now the user shall not only enter his own class but also be able to switch is visible switch let's

101
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,680
say.

102
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:21,190
So here I one to bind to a new property which I haven't created yet which I'll name is winnable and

103
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,350
I'll set this to Drew initially.

104
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:33,870
I can therefore hearing the first input still bind to let's say User class on the second input year.

105
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:44,330
I don't want a bind to is winnable to let the user changed is between true or false on this def you're

106
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,050
now blind to class as above.

107
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,050
And I will simply copy the code from there.

108
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:58,410
But the key change here is that for visible for this object I just set the value here determines whether

109
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,320
this visible class will be attached or not.

110
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,180
Now the user is able to set this.

111
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:10,340
So I will bind is to is all referring to this property which is bound to this input here.

112
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,190
With that in place let's have control enter.

113
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,800
You see Drew is populated and we clearly see something there.

114
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,580
If I remove it it seems to get removed as the input then moves up.

115
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,470
So let's change this back to Drew and let's name it blue.

116
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,740
There it is again if I remove true year it's gone.

117
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:34,230
If I sell it to anything else which is interpreted as true we see it again if I explicitly set it to

118
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,790
false we also see it.

119
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:43,710
The reason being that whatever we enter here always is a string and strings are interpreted as true

120
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,620
not cost to booleans.

121
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,860
Automatically.

122
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,400
So this is why only an empty input field will remove it.

123
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:56,580
While it's false vote because again it is treated as a string not as a boolean and strings are therefore

124
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,390
don't always treat that as true.

125
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,960
So that's just a little issue you might have with understanding this otherwise.

126
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,830
So that's important to understand how javascript that's not just how javascript works behind the scenes.

127
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,510
But again an empty input field will get rid of it.

128
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,140
Time for exercise number five.

129
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:20,910
Let's repeat the exercise number of free cell so that was the one where we were able to enter our old

130
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:26,490
class name but now with a style for the style of our choice.

131
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:33,180
So here I will set up the background color since it really is the easiest one to see though that is

132
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:39,840
the reason and I will named is my style because I want to treat the object where I not only have the

133
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:45,330
background color which is set for the user but I also want to have the width which let's say is 100

134
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:53,100
pixels again where I also have my height which is 50 or lets make it 150 pixels to mix things up.

135
00:10:53,280 --> 00:11:01,110
And then I want to have my background color important camel case or alternative normal C S s name with

136
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:08,760
the dash in this case but inside single quotation marks and then bind this to a property which is set

137
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,010
to the user later on.

138
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:18,180
So here initially I will set it to Graylands say well on this input where I want to let the user change

139
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,300
the background color.

140
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:28,980
I can set up the model to be hooked up to my style background color because it is the property I want

141
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,150
to change by the user right.

142
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:35,530
And then here on this Dith I will simply add the blind.

143
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:42,120
But now I'm not binding to class as before but I want to set the styles some binding to style and I

144
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:49,770
pass my style as an argument which is an object what style expects to get which has the width and height

145
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:55,200
and is dynamically settable background color with control enter.

146
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,720
We already see those gray def here.

147
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:04,070
And now if I changed this to blue it changes to blue.

148
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,290
And of course that works with any color which is recognized.

149
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:17,240
It should also work with hex codes so that will also work here anything which can be interpreted as

150
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,230
a valid color in the end.

151
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,180
This is how we can make parts of our a style dynamic as you see here.

152
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:30,290
And of course you can increase this degree of flexibility you cared you could add inputs setting the

153
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,240
width and height.

154
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,550
And again as multiclass of course you cannot only react to user input.

155
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:41,210
Any place where you change the background color or does with or hide or whatever will have the same

156
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,420
effect here and we'll update the styles.

157
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:48,830
This is what is styled by and is therefore in the end I'm just using user input all the time because

158
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,920
it's the easiest to simulate and to play around with for us.

159
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,060
Almost done time for the last exercise.

160
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:04,600
The most complex one here we want to treat a simple progress bar but low blows start progress.

161
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:11,030
So does Dave or shall become the progress bar in order to make it a progress bar.

162
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:17,830
I will first create a new class and you could do this in your view as instance of course to and all

163
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:24,760
I want to do here is I want to set up a width of 200 pixels and let's say a height of 20 pixels and

164
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,980
I want to give it a border of one pixel solid and black so that we can always see the empty progress

165
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:37,290
bar at least so I can now add we bind class to use view chess for that right now.

166
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:43,150
Add an array and bind to progress bar with single quotation marks.

167
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:50,320
As you can see after hitting cultural enter We now get this progress bar at the bottom of course it's

168
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,800
not very interesting right now because it's not updating.

169
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:01,180
Well we can simply update it by changing the background colors style and the with kind of.

170
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:06,260
Now a real progress bar would have this outer def.

171
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,290
This one here.

172
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:13,270
And then the inner div which reflects the actual bar whereas the outer div reflects the maximal bar

173
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,150
kind of you could set it up like this.

174
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:22,350
I will make a very simple progress bar where the whole bar grows and possibly shrinks.

175
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,660
So this is really just what I set up here.

176
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:29,950
You may of course choose a more complicated Proclus bar where you have this outer box and this inner

177
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,590
bar but then you all have to make sure that the inner bar stops growing at some point.

178
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:40,210
So does the default progress bar will always see but no one to replace it with a background color so

179
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:47,530
that we get a rolling one for that first hook up start progress with we on for example and listen to

180
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:51,600
a click event here of course where I say start progress.

181
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,610
This is a function I yet have to create.

182
00:14:54,850 --> 00:15:02,620
So I'll do this year after start in fact we have start progress which is a function where it will use

183
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:09,420
said Enter well as well because I want you with one elbow because I want to update it every hop for

184
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,940
a second let's say.

185
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:16,720
And then here the function which should get executed every half second.

186
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:21,700
Now in this function I again need access to my view instance so I'm storing it in a variable that this

187
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,160
keyword.

188
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,810
So this reference to my view instance.

189
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:33,730
And then here inside said interval I want to change some styles which I want to apply to this progress

190
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,880
bar here.

191
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:42,340
So I will add the blind style and I want to the L or what to bind to a new style a new object I create

192
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,930
in the state a property here which will name progress bar.

193
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,550
This is a normal javascript object.

194
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:55,680
And here I will have a width of let's say 0 pixels initially.

195
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:04,270
And I will have a background color of let's say red by default and you could overwrite that instead.

196
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:13,330
Well I now want to access this progress bar object that just created progress bar property and change

197
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,260
the width.

198
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,390
Now to what do I want to change with.

199
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:19,200
Though it should continuously grow.

200
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:26,350
So I somehow also need to increase to what I need to store the current width and then add something

201
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,370
to it right.

202
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:33,400
Well outside of these set interval function here but any start progress function I can simply create

203
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:39,140
a variable with which is said to S.R.O initially and then here in the progress bar.

204
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:53,450
I'd set with equal to with last 10 let's say and then here I can set the brogans bar with equal to with

205
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,600
plus.

206
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:58,040
And since does need to be in pixels pixels to convert to a string.

207
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,880
Well let's try it out by adding Tudor's style here.

208
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,560
The style I want to add is progress bar.

209
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:11,630
Remember this is your object where I'm overwriting the with down here in the central function.

210
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,370
So if I had control entered let is reload.

211
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,330
Let's head start progress.

212
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,900
And we see it grow.

213
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,750
And this will draw infinitely.

214
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,010
It won't stop.

215
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:28,600
So this would be an extra challenge I guess to implement some method to make it stop at some point.

216
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,110
I will simply reload the application here too.

217
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,120
Well make it kind of hard your.

218
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:41,150
But this will be a nice little extra but it's not really cool of the styling task which is why I don't

219
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,380
include it here.

220
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:48,590
What this should show you though is how you can work with styles how I set up my own style object your

221
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,780
as a property in the data field.

222
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:56,920
The data property of my view instance and how it ends change a part of this progress bar object that

223
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,360
with the central function.

224
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,790
And of course it could change any part of it.

225
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,170
And of course there are different ways of setting this up.

226
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:10,580
So feel free playing around with styles and classes and getting comfortable binding them dynamically

227
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,770
in different ways changing different things here in VTES.

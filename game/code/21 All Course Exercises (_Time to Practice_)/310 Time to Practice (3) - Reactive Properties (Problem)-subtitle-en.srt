1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:05,560
Back with the summer exercise we'll learn about computer properties.

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:11,880
Another key feature of future areas which makes reacting to data changes and updating related already

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,590
pending values.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,830
Very very easy.

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:21,110
So this is something you will use a lot as it really makes your application more dynamic and more flexible.

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:27,650
So therefore it's also important to really understand how to work with it and to get these core mechanics

7
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:28,810
set.

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,450
So here I'm prepared to exercise this.

9
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:37,820
And even though it's only two it shouldn't really get you into computer properties and watching properties

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,930
as well.

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,910
And the first exercise I want you to train or to practice the computer properties we have to but this

12
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:53,020
year at five and add one and we have a current value which initially set to Ciro.

13
00:00:53,050 --> 00:01:00,060
But this year as you can see increment or increase the value property but you were 5 or 1 and then a

14
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:06,850
year I want to show a result down here which doesn't exist yet which ever is says not not there yet

15
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:12,950
or whatever you like as long as the value is let's say not equal to 37 of course feel free to choose

16
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:21,200
your own check or your own threshold and then print done whenever the value is equal to 37 or as above

17
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,390
whatever your condition is.

18
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:28,670
The key thing here of course is not the value to which you're limiting or what which you're reacting

19
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:36,050
here but that the result property we're going to trade will depend on this value property.

20
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,610
That's a typical use case for a computed property.

21
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:48,140
Well the second exercise then is that I want to watch for changes in the result which we are yet to

22
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,060
create.

23
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:56,960
And once it does change I want to reset the value after five seconds and here as a hint the function

24
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,810
for setting this timer would be set time Howard with 5000 milliseconds as the second argument and the

25
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,440
function would run to a code as the first argument.

26
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,520
Side note again this will then take a closure.

27
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:16,760
So you will have to bind this that this keyword to a new variable to be able to access it inside of

28
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,050
the callback function in set time.

29
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,570
And with that then the next to you.

30
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,850
We can solve this Sigebert if you are not sure or if you simply want to compare solutions.

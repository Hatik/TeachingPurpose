1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,070
Time to practice what you learn thus far as mean a new application here and I imported bootstrapped

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:14,280
for this application I simply grabbed this link here from the bootstrap web page this CDN link and inserted

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,700
in the next HVM file.

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,500
Now in this application I basically have the same set up as before but without my home and service status

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,020
components I'm not registering any components globally or locally.

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,420
Instead I only have my main app.

7
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:34,900
Europe does object exporting you're not not even exporting your but they could export here.

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,400
And I have my template.

9
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:42,410
This is all just HVM all code with one little view Che's addition here.

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,310
I do have my loop here where I loop through a couple of servers.

11
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:53,140
Couple of list items which I don't see your on the left and then add the details on the right side note.

12
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,720
It's not possible to click a server to update.

13
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,160
This will work on this in the next course module and we dive deeper into components but it looks like

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,150
a dashboard kind of Elle's.

15
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:10,950
Got this folder here and this header does task for you now is take this application take this code which

16
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:18,120
you find attached to this lecture and restructure it such that you use components so that in your app

17
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,500
you file you only use components for a header or a folder and so on.

18
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:29,800
Try to be very granular to really Spoleto the app as far as it makes sense.

19
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,210
And then in the next with you we can compare the solutions.

20
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:39,300
It is up to you if you register your components globally or locally pick whatever you like and I'll

21
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,560
be back in the next with you where I will show you what I ended up with.

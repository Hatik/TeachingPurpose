1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,730
It's exercise time again.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,100
We learned about conditionals and loops or lists with the vord.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,480
Now it's time to practice that too.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,100
Yeah.

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,710
Really get into using that.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,830
And feel 100 percent safe about doing so.

7
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,270
The first exercise is set up here.

8
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:25,250
Once you hook up this button you see here to target the display of the two paragraphs and do DUDAS both

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,930
by using B if and we show to understand the difference.

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:35,770
Side note if you plan on using the owls V OWLS is not available on the show.

11
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,090
You can't use it on that.

12
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,180
It only works with we.

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,560
Well that is the first exercise.

14
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:47,630
The second one is about creating a list output and an ordered list of ary elements of your choice.

15
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:52,750
So basically create a new Airey and loop through it and create the last of that era.

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:59,870
Here in the HTL code also print the index of each element in the word exercise.

17
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:06,650
I want you to loop through this object here you see here and I want you to print all the key value pairs

18
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:11,650
as well as the index of each key value pair in the fourth exercise.

19
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:17,780
Also once you print an object this one here but I only want you to print the values important to create

20
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,490
a nested loop for this data array.

21
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:28,580
And as we not only have nested arrays you also might need to figure out a way to determine the current

22
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:33,710
value of the outer loop is an array for which you can create a nested loop or not.

23
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,340
So these are the four exercises.

24
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,260
Have fun with them.

25
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,970
I see a solution that you.

1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:06,350
Time we're number exercise this time about styles and classes.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,970
We learn about them in the last lectures.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:15,070
Now it's time to really work on them yourselves so that you get comfortable using them.

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,840
Here's the setup I'm using.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,830
I prepared some styles on the right here.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,230
Disaffected Dave which is this death year which basically is a day of we're a block with a black border

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,700
and then a highlight in a shooting class.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,540
We all need these classes for the very first exercise where I want to start to affect by clicking the

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,900
start button and what should the effect be.

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:44,410
I want to alternate between highlight and shrink classes on this death and we can alternate by using

11
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,780
the set entrail function.

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,020
It works kind of as I said timeout but whereas said timeout finishes after three seconds set it will

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,940
fire as every two seconds one second whatever we set up.

14
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,070
So this allows us to then kind of come up with the idea how we could switch these classes and there

15
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,940
might also be more than one way to do that.

16
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,820
To be honest.

17
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,640
So this is the first exercise we'll do.

18
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:15,870
DS second the exercise then once you do you create a couple of CNS classes on your own so be creative

19
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,400
create whatever you want and attach them to this day if you're dead.

20
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,180
Why are the Arison text that's important.

21
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,730
So uses some decks you learn about to attach Roscius as classes here.

22
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:35,550
Also feel free to mix the different styles of using a property which refers to a class name and maybe

23
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:41,190
a property which refers to an object where we have the key as a class name and the value which is true

24
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,580
or false which Well decides whether this diskless should be attached.

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,200
The word exercise lets the user enter a class.

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,690
So you should all create them still's that they that they are available.

27
00:01:53,750 --> 00:02:00,740
But then we want to use this input to well attach this class so come up with an idea of how you might

28
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:07,760
do that to listen to the user input and then attach the respective class to the staff and the fourth

29
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,390
example we will still let the user enter a class.

30
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,670
And I also want to let the user enter.

31
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,800
True or false for another class.

32
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:23,930
So did we maybe you is airy syntax word first element might be declasse to user entrance.

33
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,770
And the second one might be a class set up by you.

34
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,160
Where do users then only able to switch between true or false.

35
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,930
So that is the next exercise here.

36
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:44,060
Number five I want to repeat the exercise from number three but now with the values for styles and set

37
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,980
of class names.

38
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:50,810
So the user is still able to enter something here but the something is no longer a class name of a class

39
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,660
you created.

40
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:58,670
But the value of a style you predefined For example you could just add background color to this div

41
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,240
and let the user set the background color style.

42
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,200
Also feel free with playing around with different ways of adding this style to this.

43
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,380
And on exercise number 6.

44
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:17,510
I want to create a simple progress bar with set interwove which firers Let's say every half a second

45
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,440
and then the style bindings to increase the width of our progress bar.

46
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,230
We don't have to make that too complicated.

47
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,600
But yeah let's let's try to implement a basic bar here.

48
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,500
These are the exercises in the next what you're going through.

49
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:40,040
Possible solutions so that you can compare your solutions to mine and see if you got stuck anywhere

50
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:45,550
or if you get up with another idea which obviously can work just fine too.

51
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
So there.

1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,080
So here's my solution for this.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,080
Of course it's up to you which content you want to pass.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,220
But I chose to pass the following paragraph so very simple content.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,610
This is the content because it's not really about the content.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:23,880
As you probably recognized I'll do the same for the dream and for Duret component as the first part

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,270
of this exercise.

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,580
And of course we need a slot to now display this.

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,920
We could use named slots if we would pass more complicated content which you want to distribute in several

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,950
different pieces in this Target template and that will be a great challenge for you all.

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,220
Keep it simple and I will use one slot here.

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:51,310
The default slot I'll do the same in all three templates here in all three components.

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,300
And when I save this we see this is to conduct in all three of them.

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,570
This is very nice.

14
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:05,220
And this is all really the first part of the exercise using slots to display the content we're passing

15
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,370
in from outside.

16
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:14,900
Between opening and closing selector the average challenge was to now dynamically switch these components.

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:21,660
So I'm going to comment this out so that we have it for reference but now I want to store the currently

18
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,310
active component in a data property here in the data field.

19
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,470
So at data and return an object in my function here.

20
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,500
And it is object returning here.

21
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,400
Allagash have let's say my selected component key this name is totally up to you.

22
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,840
You don't have to use selected component.

23
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,030
And by default I want to use app blue.

24
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:51,640
Now here I want to change this with click listeners of course.

25
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:58,060
So here what I said selected component equal to Baloo.

26
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,220
Because this is the blue button.

27
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:07,710
But on the Obert few buttons here I want to change this to green though of course that should be blue

28
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,630
and green and here it should be red.

29
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:18,120
So with this set up it's time to add the dynamic component with the component keyword here with this

30
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,350
built in component component.

31
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:28,930
And there we want to bind with Colon is to the selected component property.

32
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,220
Now once I say that we only see the blue one.

33
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:39,640
Now let's still pass in this constant year so that we see that too.

34
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:47,300
And now I can switch between green and red and back to blue and that already is all I wanted to do in

35
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,310
this exercise.

36
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:55,070
With that we practice using dynamic components and slots and even the combination of both in the last

37
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,730
well part.

38
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,410
We add to year with that.

39
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,470
Let's continue.

1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,130
So I hope you were successful.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,860
This is the array of service.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,550
Now let's start by creating a new component first.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:16,360
This is the server that you file and I will copy my servers if you file in there.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,780
Remove this object though and also remove the order list and the wrapping.

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,520
I only want to have the list item here.

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,900
I'll leave the class.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:33,840
I'll remove the for loop and now I only want to output the ID here.

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:41,240
Well for that I will need my default object and set up some props because the idea shall be passed in

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,980
from outside from my servers to the file here.

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:54,200
I get the ID so when the server restart the file here I want to remove the list item here and say that

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,840
I want to import the component I just created in the server.

13
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:06,860
If you followed address on name server from top slash server view and then I'll set it up as a local

14
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,310
component in my object here.

15
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:18,320
So under components all registred with a selector of app server which remember I can use with app Dasch

16
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,620
server in the template and if I want.

17
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:28,580
So assignees server I'm importing to it and therefore I can use app server here like this or if I prefer

18
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:34,680
a dad with a dash in between app server and I want to pass the ID to that.

19
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,070
Now in order to be able to pass an ID I'd first need to loop through it.

20
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:48,570
So with we for a loop for my server in servers where servers of course refers to the service properties

21
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,390
the data field here.

22
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:57,290
And since I do that I can then pass an ID to each component which gets created throughout this loop

23
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:08,330
where I want to set id equal to server that Id accessing the individual objects here for which I'm looping.

24
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:18,170
And then the ID field in each object in each while loop iteration with this I am creating a couple of

25
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:18,730
servers.

26
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,700
We're seeing it here and outputting the IDs.

27
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,330
That's the first step.

28
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:29,390
Now I also want to be able to click on a server to load the details here in the average component.

29
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:38,780
Well to be able to click on a server I will add a click listener to this list item and to see just hand

30
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,740
cursor symbol I will simply add the cursor pointer style to that.

31
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,860
That's not yes that's normal.

32
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,560
C s s and h t m l.

33
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:59,210
So here I will then listen to a click and execute servers selected let's say therefore we should add

34
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,970
a method here.

35
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:08,680
The methods object server selected would be the name of the method which I am executing up there.

36
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:14,380
And here I want to inform the parent that a server was selected.

37
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,360
What do I want to do with that information.

38
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,120
I want to change my server details now for debt to be changed.

39
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:27,860
Informing these servers which just the parent of the individual server is not enough because server

40
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,610
detail Lifson the apt to view file.

41
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:41,460
So I could go from server with a custom event to servers with a cost me went to app and ID to do this

42
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,180
because casting events don't propagate up.

43
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,990
But that's not what I want to do.

44
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,130
I will use a bus instead.

45
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:58,600
So here I will export a constant and I'll name it Server bus which is a new view instance and then employ

46
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:05,610
server file here I will import this DS server bus here.

47
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,510
The naming is of course important because I named it in the main chair's fault.

48
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:17,580
It has a name there and I need to import that from going up one file at one folder excuse me and going

49
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,620
up another folder from the main chess file.

50
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:28,370
And with that in here I can call server bus dollar sign IMET and I want to aim at an event here.

51
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:34,740
I will name it Server selected and I will pass the IDs.

52
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:41,400
So this I.D. referring to the idea I get in here as a prop now with the event being admitted here I

53
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:49,200
can go to the server details where I want to import this server bus as well because here is the place

54
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:56,790
where I want to change something so import is from the main Che's file too.

55
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,120
And then Indee object I have here.

56
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:08,820
I also need the created lifecycle hook to then listen to server bus on so with the on method to listen

57
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,110
to the server select that event and then I want to change some data.

58
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:22,850
So here I will add the data property which again is a function returning the data object.

59
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:30,460
And here I want to set up the server which is loaded and this is null at the beginning because its undefined

60
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,620
we haven't loaded a server yet.

61
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:39,010
And here in the cold like I want to set this and I want to get the news server as an argument therefore

62
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:46,240
as I said this server equal to server that will then allow me to access things like a service status

63
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,500
and ID.

64
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:55,170
Now to do that however I need to go back to server and here I only get the ID passed in as a prop.

65
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,090
Well let's change this.

66
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:02,320
Let's instead get the whole server and output server ID instead.

67
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,950
Here in the template and for this to work I need to go to my server's component here too and not only

68
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:16,030
pass the ID but the whole server in each loop iteration just holds server object.

69
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:23,180
With that in place I'm now outputting it here or I'm getting it here to my server details correctly.

70
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,060
And whenever I select a server server it is set to something else.

71
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:36,550
And this allows me to override this template add a new paragraph where I use the if to check if server

72
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:46,660
is actually set and if it is not set I want to say Please select a server and otherwise I can use the

73
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,920
else if.

74
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:59,760
If this is the case of a service selected I'd say server number and then we said server ID selected

75
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:05,600
stators and then output the server status.

76
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,210
So if that was too fast what I did is any server component.

77
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,830
I implemented a method.

78
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,870
Q Well basically listened to clicks on this list item.

79
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,090
Where I emit the service selected event on my server bus the server bus is set up here in the main Chia's

80
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:21,880
file.

81
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,750
And with that server select that event I want to pass.

82
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,630
Well not the ID but the server.

83
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,540
This needs to be adjusted.

84
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,820
The server is a prop I'm getting set from outside.

85
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,020
It gets said here in the servers view fall where I loop through all the service and create the app server

86
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,440
component.

87
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:49,510
This is the one living in the server dog file and I passed the server of the current Lubitz ration with

88
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,630
the server prop's I set up there this process.

89
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,900
So it is set in this loop where a loop from my array of servers with this set up.

90
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:06,620
We still see all these Cirus but if I click on one we see it now changes to the server we actually selected

91
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,780
the missing piece now is a Vachan button on the right which allows me to change to service status back

92
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:20,510
to normal need to change the service status back to normal.

93
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:27,350
I will go to my server details component and there I will add a horizontal line say change to normal

94
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,860
on a button I added.

95
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:35,150
And here I want to execute will listen to a click event and set reset status.

96
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:40,490
For example add this in the methods object.

97
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,330
I have to add to my view instance therefore.

98
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,090
So here I have reset stators as a method.

99
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:56,580
And then here I can do it very very easily by simply saying this server status equals normal.

100
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:03,500
And then you might say OK now we need to pass it back and updated in this array of servers here.

101
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,200
But we don't keep in mind this is an object.

102
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:15,470
And I said earlier objects are reference types therefore the objects in this array only exist of once

103
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,180
each one place in memory for each of these objects.

104
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:27,020
Now when I pass them to another component it's still the same object I'm only copying the pointer to

105
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,710
this place in memory.

106
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:35,690
Hence if I added my server in such a component like here in the server detail component it still edits

107
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,370
the same place and memory.

108
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,430
You will see this in action here.

109
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:46,910
If I click on any sort of very critical here I change it to normal I navigate away and I select server

110
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:54,320
2 again it's still normal because it was edited in this array because server or because this object

111
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,390
is a reference type that was a rather long exercise.

112
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,130
But we practice a lot of the things we saw in this lecture.

113
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:10,160
I hope you feel confident using props and casting events and even buses to communicate across components

114
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,000
and manage your state and pass data.

115
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,020
With that let's move on.

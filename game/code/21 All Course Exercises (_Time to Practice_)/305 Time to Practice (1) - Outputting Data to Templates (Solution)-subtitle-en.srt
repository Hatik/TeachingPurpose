1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,860
Let's start holding this exercise the first task was to put your name and your age.

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:16,390
Well we already got the name field so populate this with Max and then it's also important or acquired.

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,060
Q Also at H field.

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,360
So let me quickly do this and also a 2:27 since this is my age up here.

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:31,510
You can then replace your name with double curly braces for E-string and oblations syntax and output

6
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,430
name you're referring to this name property and the data property.

7
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,830
Remember we don't need this or anything at the beginning.

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:47,090
No this no data nothing like that we can directly access name here in the parentheses and then one output

9
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,680
H using the same syntax and referring to H.

10
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,890
If I saved this by hitting control ENTRAR we see Max 27 so we're there.

11
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,570
So this is the first task solved.

12
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,990
The second task was to output my age multiplied by free.

13
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,040
Well that's really easy to do.

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,710
Alig and use double curly braces to introduce interpellation syntax and then a year I referred to my

15
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:17,810
H property which I already store youtoo the first exercise we finished and I simply multiplied by free.

16
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:23,940
Does how easy we can output a JSA expression or the result of this expression as you will see when I

17
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,600
hit enter.

18
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,100
We see 81.

19
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,170
Well I still got some time to get to that point here.

20
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:37,320
This is how easy we use a javascript expression but when the cold embraces the word exercise does something

21
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,190
or requires something similar.

22
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:48,490
But here I don't want to output a simple calculation in here instead of what I call a function.

23
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:55,100
So let's first add a method to the methods array down here where the methods object excuse me and choose

24
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,510
any name you like.

25
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:08,460
I'm going to name it random and this will be a function where I simply return Marth random does that

26
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,520
allows me up here to call this function.

27
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,930
And I've been hitting control enter.

28
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:18,710
We see a random number each changing each time as I repeatedly.

29
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,890
Well reload this application or reload.

30
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,160
This page does how easy it is.

31
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:28,340
The key thing to take away here is that random function call here.

32
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:34,490
Just as an average Chalons expression like in the second exercise there we execute the code right but

33
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,620
when you call the braces.

34
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,080
Now we're calling a function.

35
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,130
But in both exercise or both tasks we actually rends up javascript code between the quali braces.

36
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:49,470
Doesn't matter if it is a function call or the code or the calculation itself.

37
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,980
Now it's getting interesting.

38
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,720
We're leaving the world of this curly brace interpellation syntax instead.

39
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,840
Here I now want to search an image on Google and output it here.

40
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,080
My image tag.

41
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,990
Well what could be output.

42
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,120
Well I will be there untreated.

43
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:12,680
And simply search for Buquet as on the images and let's pick what it is looks really awesome.

44
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:19,750
Let's pick this one I now want to output this image of goods I could simply add my link here hit Control

45
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,200
enter and well yeah we all see it.

46
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,680
It's a bit too big.

47
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,060
So yes that would be the image.

48
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:34,580
Maybe we should add some style here to make this more visible.

49
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,880
So let's add a width and height here.

50
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:41,950
Yeah.

51
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,920
That looks better.

52
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,130
Of course the dimensions are now messed up but at least we see it.

53
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,540
But anyway that's not how I want to add this image.

54
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,470
I don't want to paste your link in here.

55
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:57,320
Instead I want to store it here in a property in my data field image which is a string holding this

56
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,950
u r l and then up here.

57
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,010
I simply want to bind this source attribute.

58
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,490
Now we learn that it won't work if I use diabolically braces here.

59
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,170
This is not how it works.

60
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,320
This will resolve to an error.

61
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,200
We can try it out.

62
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:16,740
If I add image here what we don't see the image clearly because again this is not how it works.

63
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,650
We can't use to call the brace and text here in an aged female attribute.

64
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:26,260
We therefore have to bind it using we bind like this.

65
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:34,320
This outhouse view Chia's that this source attribute here is no longer directly controlled by age team

66
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:40,760
also to say but instead that now view as controls and sets the value dynamically.

67
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:46,730
This allows me to pass the source of this dynamic value which here is the image property between the

68
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,880
quotation marks important no call the braces here.

69
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:56,320
Since we already are in the UK as the world due to this heavy bind directive here with that set up of

70
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,240
a now it control enter we now see the image again but setting it dynamically fruiterer's laying down

71
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,880
there for the last exercise.

72
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,100
We're kind of doing the same but now way have the value of this input.

73
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:17,270
And again the first idea might be to use the curly braces here and output name and that of course won't

74
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:22,450
work we see curly braces named on there now because again this is not how it works.

75
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,770
We can't use curly braces here.

76
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:32,650
Instead we will again use we bind to bind this value attribute using the bind directive NUJ as today

77
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:38,660
for now make this dynamic and allowing us to now simply pass the property name between the quotation

78
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,210
marks.

79
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,390
Thus upon hitting control enter we now see my real name down there.

80
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:51,410
This word the first exercise and outputting data should have been too complicated but yet it's very

81
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:57,020
important to get this right to understand these core mechanics because we're going to use them throughout

82
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:57,720
this course.

83
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:03,340
And if you get some issues here now is the time to get 100 percent clear about what you're doing.

84
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:09,230
Because we will need this and everything else kind of builds up on that that let's continue with the

85
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,270
next lectures.

00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:08,310
Time to use the things we all learn in this module and put it into practice with a few little exercises

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:14,070
about forms Specifically here's what I want you to try before then and the next would you show you which

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,330
solution I came up with.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,630
So the first exercises that we should create as sign up form where you are treat the following information

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:28,470
full name which is a first and last name field mail password and then a radio button if we want to store

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,440
the data yes or no at the bottom of this template you can find this template and attached to this lecture

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:34,920
here.

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,240
You'll find the simple output data sheet as we saw it before where we can then present this information

9
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,200
in the second exercise here.

10
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:51,000
I want you to enhance that by making sure that the form which you have to read up here of course is

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,780
only visible as long as we haven't hit the reset button which you have to create as well where as the

12
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,220
data sheet here is only visible after you hit the submit button.

13
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,640
So that's a little addition.

14
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:10,650
And the third exercise I want you to take your full name which is a first and last name input field

15
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:16,740
and create your own component which kind of combines both inputs into one single control you can then

16
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,390
dump into your project here to get a full name out of the box.

17
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:27,280
Well of that I wish you good luck or good experience with that and I'll see you in a solution video.

1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:08,310
So we want to build this new directive which warrants merks kind of like a B on so directives and here

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,280
directive.

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:19,960
Well you may choose any name I will choose Custom on as the name and in my custom on directive I have

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,780
my bind to work here that's my important book in this case here I do have my element and my binding

5
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,990
these are the two arguments I will need to access.

6
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,560
Now let me quickly add a button here.

7
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:42,220
And I will add a method in my object your methods where I will say clicked and here I don't want to

8
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,090
follow an alert.

9
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,960
So it's not really about the function we execute here.

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,180
It is about being able to execute one.

11
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,950
So I learned I was collect nice.

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,430
So this is a function.

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,190
Now I don't want to use my directive we custom on like this.

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,870
And then here I will execute collect.

15
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,450
So I pass a reference to this function.

16
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,680
I don't want to execute.

17
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:15,810
Now therefore what I can do is here in the element I want to listen to any event.

18
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,020
Now I'm not specifying which you went right now.

19
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,310
Let's start simple by forcing that to be a click event.

20
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,030
How can I do this.

21
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:32,200
Well keep in mind the element is my native h m l element and therefore of course I have access to on

22
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:41,680
click like this and on click now takes a function which should get executed whenever we click on this

23
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,730
element.

24
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:50,470
Now what I can do here is I can say execute my binding value of which I know it will be a reference

25
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,210
to a function so I can execute like a function.

26
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:54,940
Let's see if this works.

27
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,580
If I now go back and hit click me we see I was clicked was that easy.

28
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,360
It is.

29
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,270
So that is really how easy it is to get started with this.

30
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,790
Now let's find it a little bit.

31
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,770
First of all not really connected to this directive but I want to give it a spot and some styling to

32
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,690
make it look nicer.

33
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:18,290
Second of all I don't want to listen to you on click here.

34
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:24,130
Instead I want to be able to listen to any event and I want to set about flexible event listener for

35
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,120
that.

36
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,440
Therefore I'm going to copy it or comment out that and instead I want to add an event listener here.

37
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,680
And how do you add an event listener.

38
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,380
Well we have to specify the type of the wind as a string.

39
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,900
And then the second argument is the function we want to execute.

40
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:49,920
While that's pretty easy the type is something we can extract because that is simply our binding arg.

41
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:57,280
Now we're not passing this yet but I can pass it with a colon click for example and then as I can hear

42
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,650
at the type here this will be converted to a string.

43
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,030
So it is absolutely fine to use it like this.

44
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,440
And then I want to execute my function.

45
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,910
I'm just extracting this and separate constants to make it really clear what happens here.

46
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:15,900
So this is my conc my my binding value which again will be a reference to a function I can execute.

47
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,950
So will execute the function here.

48
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,960
Important don't pass parentheses here.

49
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,130
You want to just pass the reference to the event listener.

50
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,960
Javascript will execute this automatically for you once you do click.

51
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,450
Now with this let me try this modified code still works like a charm.

52
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,480
Awesome.

53
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,670
Now with that we already finished the exercise.

54
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,990
Now I want to try something else and also add a little depth here which I give some style.

55
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:51,940
Let's say some with 100 pixels and height 100 pixels and so that we can see the background color of

56
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,470
light green.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,860
So this day of year and year I one to listen to mouse enter.

58
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:09,490
So to do that all restructure this into multiple lines here I want to have my custom on directive and

59
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:22,240
I want to listen to you mouse entry year and execute a function I will pass where I will create Maoz

60
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,870
entry for that.

61
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:31,110
And here I simply want to console log mouse entered

62
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:42,850
and I also want to provide a number of function mouse leaf and you guess what I want to enter there

63
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,850
or out of their mouths leafed.

64
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:52,520
Now of course I also will hope to zap some mouse enter here and want to execute mouse entry.

65
00:04:52,540 --> 00:05:01,270
So this newly created function and I also want to hook up my other listener the custom on Maoz leave

66
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,980
and execute mouse leave here.

67
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,930
And don't put the parentheses here like this.

68
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,280
Now let's see there isn't a console.

69
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,790
The clearer this was entered.

70
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,320
Miles entered Musli.

71
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,720
So this is really flexible as you can see.

72
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,230
We can listen to multiple events can of course so click here.

73
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:26,720
That is how this works and how easy it was to trade our cast in their act of which kind of works like

74
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:35,630
the on just by using native Dom javascript things like eventless not here passing an argument and passing

75
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:42,920
a value the function which should get executed or the reference to this function really short and hopefully

76
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:50,690
dead showed you how you can use the features native elements of your native javascript office you to

77
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,520
build powerful directives.

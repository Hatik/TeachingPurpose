1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,950
So where are you successful.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,240
Let's start with Exercise 1.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,710
Creating this sign up for.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,100
Now we're in a form element here already with some bootstrap columns.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:18,150
So what I'll do here is I'll agree that they have with a class for any group to give it some nice pooched

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:18,980
styling.

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:26,500
And then there are want to have a label where I say first name and then I have my input which is which

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,600
is of type text of course which shall hold my first name.

9
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,760
I will give it a class for and control to improve the styling of it.

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,500
And then I'm going to copy that.

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,260
You also get a number of forms for for the last name and you could style this differently to have them

12
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,250
sit next to each other or something like that.

13
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,210
I'll keep that really simple.

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,820
They're off there we want to fetch the e-mail address so as Shelby the e-mail address here and then

15
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,530
let's see.

16
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,630
We shall fetch the password next.

17
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,710
Now here of course we shall Tabe to change the type to password.

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,470
I think that makes sense to hide it.

19
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,140
And lastly I want to create these radio buttons.

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,180
Now radio buttons with the bootstrap framework are created like this.

21
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,200
We still have our forum group here.

22
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:23,080
But then inside this form group we want to have a label and in this Laili we have already button then.

23
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:30,510
So the type is there for radio and we set a value which is assigned to you as a radio button.

24
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,100
And here this is yes.

25
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,410
And of course we display Yes here.

26
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:41,210
So the value in the HMO element is what will be stored thereafter and yes thereafter is basically just

27
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:44,500
the text we can see in our template.

28
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:49,770
Now the I've already but belongs to the same form group so I'll added like this.

29
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:54,890
And you I want to have no ass de-value and also as what I see here.

30
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,140
So let's see those in the running application.

31
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,840
I'm quickly going to split up my server here again.

32
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,950
And this is what I end up with.

33
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,850
Looks good.

34
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:09,180
Now with that for him to create an H-G amount the next one is to hook it up to you.

35
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,270
Well our properties and create these properties in the first place.

36
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,790
So let me create these properties quickly.

37
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:22,350
I've got an empty object down there so I'm changing this by using my data or by setting up my data.

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:32,710
And here I want to have first name which is empty by default.

39
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,810
Thereafter I want to have a last name which is empty by default.

40
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:37,920
Then I.

41
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,850
Empty by default and a password.

42
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,760
You guessed it empty by default.

43
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,670
And then also my store data field which is such a true initially.

44
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,700
Now I can hook them up.

45
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:58,660
So here I want to assign view model first name to this form group your full form control I should say

46
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:05,500
then for the next it's the last name and then for this one year it's the email forward the password

47
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:11,940
it's obviously the password property I'm assigning and then a year for this radio button.

48
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:19,630
Well to each of the two radio buttons I assigned the store data model because keep in mind we have to

49
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:25,720
assign the same model here to make them alternate to let fut. know that these two radio buttons are

50
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,320
alternatives and should be bound to the same property.

51
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:35,820
Now with that I can already output my content here and I can output the full name here which simply

52
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,500
is my first name.

53
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,880
And then whitespace and then my last name it's as easy as this.

54
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:49,210
We could also create a computer property named full name which kind of concatenates our string here

55
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,530
will be an alternative.

56
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,430
Nice little challenge you could do if you want to.

57
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:59,950
Then down there I of course want to output the email and then a year the password of course.

58
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,470
And finally here I want to output the choice regarding the data storage.

59
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:14,760
Now if I save this and we enter something here like Max Schwartz That's my name choose your name your

60
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,120
of course any email address of your choice.

61
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,170
And finally a password while that looks good to me.

62
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,710
I think we got a nice working simple form here.

63
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,810
Now the next step is that we take this form and enhanced by adding a submit button and only showed a

64
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,880
form as long as we haven't submitted it but once we submitted showed it data sheet here at the bottom.

65
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,340
So let's we're going to this next to you add a separate button to this.

66
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,370
Well surprisingly first add the button here.

67
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,590
Submit the form and set this to type submit.

68
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:56,280
Now I want to add a click listener of course and importantly I add pre-event year to prevent the default

69
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,750
which would be again to send this form to the server.

70
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,900
I don't want that to happen.

71
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,980
I don't want this form to reach a server.

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,350
I want to handle with you chaps.

73
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:10,800
So here instead I'd choose to do something up on a click that could execute a Mathare.

74
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,140
And typically you would probably do this to then use your data in this method.

75
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,260
But here all I need is really just a variable holding a true or false value which decides if I should

76
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,580
show the form or the data.

77
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:32,040
So here I will have my submitted property which is set to false initially and I will set this to true

78
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,410
here.

79
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:41,130
So submitted equals true now and this submitted property year decides whether I show this row here.

80
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:47,370
As for in so it's just form I want to show that.

81
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:55,560
So we if it was submitted or I should say not submitted so if it's not submitted then we showed a form

82
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,790
if it was submitted.

83
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:03,050
Well in this case I want to show this and here I use submitted therefore.

84
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,190
Now let's see this in action.

85
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:05,950
Looks good.

86
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,480
Let's give the butler some styling that looks that looks ugly.

87
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,650
So here it gets the button and Button primary bootstrap classes here.

88
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,280
Just going to restructure that so that everything is on one page here.

89
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:24,120
And now if safety's looks much better i'll let me quickly fill out this form again so that we have some

90
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,450
nice well used to play around with and set this to yes.

91
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,420
Again separate the form and we see yes here.

92
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:39,600
Q Now there was one thing I don't like the yes field is no pre-select that here I have to select one.

93
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,290
It's empty at the beginning.

94
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,550
So let's fix this too.

95
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:49,890
It is of course not pre-select because I'm storing true or false here in my stored variable but of course

96
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,980
here I have yes and no.

97
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,580
So that's a little mistake here.

98
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,590
We should of course change this too.

99
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,040
Yes.

100
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,580
For example and now we see it's pre-selected and I still can submit it an hour.

101
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:06,430
What's he know here since I switched it just a second ago so that we finished the second exercise added

102
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,120
the button.

103
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:13,950
Now let's turn to exercise right and maybe put the button here below exercise to sort of you can clearly

104
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,670
see this.

105
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:25,460
And now exercise free once is to basically go up to the fields here to the first and last name and put

106
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,300
that into a separate component which we then can use as a form control.

107
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,780
So let's do that now.

108
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,460
I first will create this component.

109
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,480
I will name it.

110
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,840
Full name dot view here.

111
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:44,540
And of course I will have a template in there and I will have a scrub tag I won't use any special styling

112
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,330
here.

113
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:52,010
Now what I'll do is I will quickly copy the code from there that will be my template here of course.

114
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:57,470
The two input fields though I have to grouped them in a separate div because we may only have one top

115
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,840
level element if you remember that.

116
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:05,270
And then you hopefully also remember how we set up our own control.

117
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,300
We need to be able to get a value passed in.

118
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,990
So this value prop and then to return the input event or emit the input event.

119
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:23,770
Well Therefore I set up props here and I expect to get a value and then I also need to have a Meffert

120
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,810
somehow in my methods array where I can emit an input.

121
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,370
Well let's first work with this value here.

122
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:38,440
The interesting thing is that I have two different inputs year and I kind of need to split up a value

123
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:46,010
I get passed in into two fields and concatenate any input I have into a field I can output to do that.

124
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:51,630
I'll first add a computer property all name ID first name.

125
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,090
This of course is a function of all computer properties are it or a method.

126
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,050
I should say.

127
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,510
And the goal is to take the first word from my value.

128
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,000
Now that could be complicated.

129
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:08,930
If I have let's say a name which has free parts like a middle name and between that is something we'll

130
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,250
have to handle differently.

131
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:17,980
I'll keep it simple and assume I only get two parts separated with whitespace so up empty space.

132
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:27,520
Then if this is the case I can simply say the first name is the value and then I call the split function

133
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,450
and split on the whitespace.

134
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,790
Now this is an array.

135
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,370
And the first element is of course the first name.

136
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:41,170
And I'm going to copy this to also get my last name here.

137
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:47,920
Just need to copy that though and there I want to get the second element in disarray I split.

138
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:50,920
So that should be my last name then.

139
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:58,350
And with that I can now go to my input here and pass the value to this.

140
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:06,790
And the value here is of course my first name and the value on the second input is of course my last

141
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,370
name.

142
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,620
This is one thing.

143
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,450
Now with that I'm not emitting my input event though.

144
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:22,020
But let's already see if that works or we can see that I pass my full name in there.

145
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:28,500
So if I go back to the Apter view file I have to register my components so I first have to import it

146
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:34,500
of course so import full name from full

147
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:37,970
AUPs from.

148
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,160
That is why I don't get support here from full named are you and register it as a local component components

149
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,030
shell.

150
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:54,690
Therefore I have my app full name where I have the full name here.

151
00:10:54,750 --> 00:11:00,330
I also replace first name a last name here and instead only have my full name and I will provide a default

152
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:05,040
value so that I can see if I correctly passed it down to my component.

153
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,730
So you're able populate this with my name.

154
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:12,640
So that's my Apfel name all added here.

155
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:22,920
AB full name like this and I will use the model to set up or to pass my full name there.

156
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,330
I also need to just sit down there and restringing depletion.

157
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,600
I also want to put full name does new property just create it.

158
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,460
Let's have a look.

159
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:32,960
Already looks good.

160
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,630
We see it is correctly split up into component we inserted.

161
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,910
That's great.

162
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:47,450
Now the missing pieces to also correctly submitted so that once I added that here we see it updated

163
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,120
here which currently doesn't happen.

164
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,920
That of course doesn't happen because of a full name component.

165
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:58,800
I'm not emitting events upon changing it so I need to have listeners on both inputs.

166
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:04,070
I'll listen to an input here and fire name changed.

167
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,490
And the same is of course true for my last name here.

168
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,500
Now I need a name change method here then and I do get to event past in here.

169
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,690
Now the important thing is the name change event.

170
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:25,640
Well what do you have to do it depends on which input amidst this event because a noted event target

171
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,200
will be this input element and this will hold a value which I now need to update in my name.

172
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:39,230
But to do this I need to know if I need to append to the first name or pre-painted to the last name.

173
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:47,390
So in order to be able to notice I will pass an argument here whereas say first and here I say lost

174
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:55,070
and of course all that once you pass to devolvement which I get passed by the DOM kind of automatically

175
00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:02,880
as you or I can now check is first and therefore lets even make this easier let's say true or false.

176
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,230
So I'd check if it is the first thing which changed.

177
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:16,670
If it is for Estamos so if is for is is true then a 1 to emit and he went which is called it and he

178
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,000
and some data.

179
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:25,190
Well I went to him it is in all cases so let's put it outside of this and instead let's create a variable

180
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:34,130
let name it's empty at the beginning and hearable and say name equals and now it's the first name which

181
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:41,030
changed so I can say you went target value because that will be the input of my first input element

182
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,330
here.

183
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,040
Event target value.

184
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:51,740
So the first name changed and now I of course also want to concatenate a whitespace and then my last

185
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,180
name.

186
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,990
The computer property last name here.

187
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,930
Our y is.

188
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,700
If it's not the first name I want to do the same here but now of course the other way around.

189
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,990
So now I do have my

190
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:18,320
first name which is constant and then I do add the changed value from the event which is now all referring

191
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,380
to the last name input.

192
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,120
Now if name set year.

193
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:26,570
I now have to set value equal to name of course to update my value property.

194
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:32,510
Otherwise my computed properties are not calculated correctly and then I should be able to output this

195
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,720
value here.

196
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:39,760
Let's see if this works as expected if I reload this page and I change this to Maximillian.

197
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,180
Submit the form.

198
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,830
While that looks good to me.

199
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,660
Now let's see what happens if I remove the last name.

200
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:55,050
All looks great and if I change the last name and the first name perfect cell the custom control seems

201
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,390
to work as it should.

202
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,720
And I hope it became clear how to bolt and control.

203
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:07,110
It always comes down to being able to handle the Purab named value and emit an event named input.

204
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:14,760
And with that I'd say that were great steps in getting deeper into forms and really understanding them.

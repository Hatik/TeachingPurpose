1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:07,110
Time we're number exercise we learn about events and how we could work with them time to put this into

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:12,670
practice and get deeper into when to really work with them without any issues.

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,240
Here are the exercises I prepared in the first task.

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,310
I want you to simply show an alert whenever we click this button.

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,280
This should be pretty straightforward to handle with an event handler and probably a function just a

6
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,300
little bit.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:33,670
The second exercise here then is a bit of a more advanced technique but we also learn this here.

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:41,470
I want you to listen to a key down event on this input here and store the value in a data property.

9
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:47,580
So we kind of need access to the value of this input field here of this input element.

10
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,670
And here's a hint.

11
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:55,980
Event target of value might give us value the key down event might be one you want to listen to to successfully

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,890
store the value in a data property and we output this value property below this input so that you can

13
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,810
see what we entered.

14
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:08,330
The third exercise here then takes the last one the second one.

15
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,660
But here we want to make sure that yes we still listen to key down but only if the entry keys pressed.

16
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,760
Do we want to refresh this value property.

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,620
We also learn a way to well constrain the keys we're listening to.

18
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:28,530
These are the free exercises using how you call functions how you execute code how you pass arguments

19
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,870
how you work with the default event argument.

20
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,690
And with that said let's get started.

21
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,450
And in the next video we can solve this together in case you got stuck somewhere or simply want to compare

22
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,350
your solution.

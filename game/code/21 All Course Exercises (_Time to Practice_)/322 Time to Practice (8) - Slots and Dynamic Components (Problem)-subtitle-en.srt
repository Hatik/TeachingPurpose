1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,200
Time for our exercise this is a little application.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,540
We get three buttons for three different templates and then it looks like we got free this year with

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,820
different colors.

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:17,830
Well these devs are actually free components which have absolutely nothing inside their template except

5
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:24,340
that the div which had style with scope's styles so that it stays inside this component and then the

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:30,100
up file is simply have the buttons and these free components which I loaded my object down there so

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,960
far so straightforward.

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:39,010
Now maybe you already guess what the exercise is but as a first step I want you to pass in some content

9
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:47,410
of your choice can be some text can be aged him out code to each of these templates here the same text

10
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:53,850
or the same content it should be because in the next lesson I want to dynamically switch that.

11
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,720
Now back to the first part passing in some content.

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:02,910
Of course we want to pass it in between the opening and closing select or so not as a prop.

13
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:09,610
Now regarding the second part dynamically switching these components I want you to hook up buttons and

14
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:16,060
add some code so that only one of the free templates is displayed and the arrow will do are not.

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,170
And we can switch between them while of slots and dynamic components.

16
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,390
You should be well prepared to do that.

17
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,190
Let's meet forward a solution in the next video.

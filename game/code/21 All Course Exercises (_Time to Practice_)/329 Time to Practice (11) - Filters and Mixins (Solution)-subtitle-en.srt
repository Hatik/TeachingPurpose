1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:08,460
So let's start exercise one let's build a local folder where I want to basically have some text like

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,770
some text which should be reversed.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,670
Now it is a local folder.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,530
It's as easy as adding folders here.

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,040
And let's give it a name.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,360
For example reworks what makes sense I guess.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:27,030
Now reverse of course is a method like all filters are and they get the value we want to work with and

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,200
then we return value.

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:35,040
Now to reverse a string we first have to split it into individual characters so that we have an array

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,060
of characters instead of a string.

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,350
Then we can call the reverse function on that array.

12
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:47,630
And then we can again join it jointed with an empty string to join characters next to each other and

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,820
have no character in between.

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,250
That is really all that is the reverse filter.

15
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:58,400
And I can show you how it works by now outputting this in string interpolation year.

16
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,120
So outputting it like this.

17
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,060
Of course some text now would not work.

18
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:08,540
So we have to turn this into a string and then apply our rewords filter here.

19
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,100
I had to turn it into a string.

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,550
Otherwise Mujeres would look for a property named some text which wouldn't make sense because it's a

21
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,130
property name to begin with.

22
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,370
So let's see if that word it looks great to me.

23
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:26,290
We see some text was indeed completely reversed not just individual words but the whole string which

24
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,430
is exactly what our folder here does.

25
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,720
So that's what's really quick and easy does for his local folder.

26
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:38,150
The next task is to build a global folder which also uses a word.

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:44,440
Let's take the example here test and then output outputs this new string here which also gives us the

28
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,560
length for a global filter.

29
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:54,560
I will go into the main Chia's file and here I want you are just to a new folder with the folder.

30
00:01:54,730 --> 00:02:04,940
Let's give it a name of let's say calculate killed Kule late length because that is what it does.

31
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:10,570
And it shall be a function I'll use iOS 6 and tax year which takes a value of course.

32
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:19,140
And it shell then return a new string based on that this new string shall basically be our value because

33
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,420
we don't want to change the word but we do want to append something we want to append a white space

34
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,060
and opening parentheses.

35
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,170
And in the end we will have a closing parentheses like this.

36
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:38,310
But in between those parentheses we now want to have the length being calculated and we can do that

37
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:45,200
by simply applying or using value length values of string and strings have the length property.

38
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,110
Now let's try this out.

39
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:53,470
We created this calculate length faulter here and therefore I can quickly turn this into String interpellation

40
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,170
here for that of course I need to use a string again because otherwise you would look for a property

41
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,610
named test here.

42
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,740
And then I can use.

43
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:06,340
Whoops then I can use calculate length like this.

44
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,460
Let's see this in action looks exactly how I wanted it to look like.

45
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,460
Let's try it with something else like for example my name Your Choose Your name of course.

46
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,210
Well that looks about right.

47
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,630
So these were the first two exercises solved by using falters.

48
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,050
Now let's do the same by using computer properties.

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,730
So I will quickly copy the two paragraphs I used before because I want to use the same text so that

50
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,420
we have exactly the same results.

51
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,690
But now of course with computer properties.

52
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,580
Now how do we do that.

53
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:46,590
Now the issue of course is that here we're hard coding some text there for it using a computer property

54
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,460
on some text like this is a bit hard.

55
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,920
Now let me quickly adjust is to be able to use a computer property correctly and to have a more realistic

56
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,940
use case all create my data method here to then return my data object in the end.

57
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:14,610
And here I will have my first text which shall be some text here and I'll have my second text which

58
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:21,880
is my name in this case as I used it and of course year that shouldn't be equal sign but a colon.

59
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:26,160
So now I have this stored in properties I can use here.

60
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:32,730
So first text and second text that you could of course also use this in the above two examples where

61
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,280
we use vulturous.

62
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,400
Actually let's do that cell that we really have to same things.

63
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,100
There's those second text here and now I can set up my computer properties.

64
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,130
So I'll set up the computed object here and I want you to create my reverse computed property.

65
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,580
Let's say we were just like this.

66
00:04:52,020 --> 00:05:00,060
And in the reverse computed property I simply want to return this first text and then again split with

67
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:08,280
an empty string to split by character rewords and then join again with an empty string.

68
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,940
So that's the same logic as in the folder.

69
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,450
And to say it was of course true for the calculate length

70
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,320
property here.

71
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:29,730
Here I want to return this second text Plass and then whitespace parentheses closing parentheses in

72
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,350
between.

73
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:39,820
Just like before I want to have my second text length of data can now go up there and here of course

74
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:45,860
I no longer use the folders since that year I want to output the worst property to compute the property.

75
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,550
And here I want you.

76
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:55,480
Well let's let's name it length where because it knows its name so its length.

77
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,310
So let's use this here.

78
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,860
Now let's head over and see if that works.

79
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:06,550
Looks perfect to me we get the same results twice in the first block here using a folder or folders.

80
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,670
And the second block using computer properties.

81
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:18,730
Now since we outsourced the calculate length function year into compute the property we can no longer

82
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:24,400
share it as a filter which is too bad because now if you would have a natural place in the app where

83
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,980
we wanted to use that of course we would have to have the same property names and text there but if

84
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,690
that would be the case well then we can't use like this.

85
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:42,700
So in order to make it available in our broken bones to let me create a mix in your all name and length

86
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:50,370
of where makes in and as a challenged print file and hearable simply export a constant length aware

87
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,620
makes in like this which is an object.

88
00:06:54,730 --> 00:07:02,290
And all I want to have in this object here is my computer property object here.

89
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:10,570
I don't need reversed but I want to have length aware in year and then I can now go back to the applet

90
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,250
view file.

91
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:21,070
Remove length of where you're therefore add D mix ins array 2 now also at is newly treated mix in I

92
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,440
have to import it first of course.

93
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,230
So I will imported from these langue where mix in javascript file.

94
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,280
Therefore here is the length of where mix in which I now add here.

95
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:39,290
And with that if I save it and let's reload check the console if you get any arrows.

96
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,670
Looks great to me.

97
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:48,730
So that we first used some folders Dan used some computer properties and finally outsource to one computer

98
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:52,540
property into a mix in which we could now use multiple components.

99
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:58,630
One restriction of course all components are we want to use that have to use as second text property

100
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,200
to store the text you want to transform there.

101
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:06,450
And with that I'd say nice little practicing on filters and make sense.

102
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,600
I hope you feel comfortable using them now.

103
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,320
And with that let's move on.

1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,680
Well that was quite a big module but it was important.

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:12,360
You now hopefully get a better understanding on how the view in science works how view chairs works

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,270
behind the scenes how it creates these instances how the lifecycle of such instance looks like and how

4
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,960
we may use that.

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:28,230
With that you will really get a lot of tools already in your pocket to use chairs with you know how

6
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:34,290
to use it with template you know how it works behind the scenes you know how it basically works with

7
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:34,980
that.

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:42,510
We can now make the next big step and move on to a different set up a more complex set up a real development

9
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:49,470
work flow on our machine before we then dive into more advanced topics like components routeing animations

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,390
and much much more.

11
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,520
So let's move on.

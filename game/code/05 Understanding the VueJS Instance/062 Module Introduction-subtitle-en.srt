Welcome to discourse Marchal after two modules of diving super deep into view shapes and learning how

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,160
to interact with the DOM how to change it how to react to events how to conditionally show Condon how

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,700
to render lists.

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,830
I now want to focus on The View.

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:25,730
Instance this thing we created all the time with new view and then passing this object.

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,330
Let's take a closer look.

7
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,560
How does it work.

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,810
Which properties do we have.

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:36,660
How is it created which will lifecycle doesn't run through how we may we use it in ways we haven't used

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,790
it before and much more.

11
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:45,250
This module will be a bit more theoretical and if you're not interested and all feel free to skip it

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:52,510
though for really understanding how VTES works I strongly recommend having a look at it or at least

13
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,950
having a look at the specific videos which sound interesting to you.

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,090
Well with that let's dive in and work our way of fruity vouchsafes instance.

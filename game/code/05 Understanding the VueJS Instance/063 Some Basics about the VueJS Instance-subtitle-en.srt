1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:07,760
I'm back in Shiahs fiddle and here's a very simple Fedele where I get my app where I output a title

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:13,790
which we can find in the data property down there where I get a button hooked up to a wind with a view

3
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,020
on some text here.

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:21,350
We have today or hooked up to the show method in The Muppets property or our view instance and we get

5
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,160
to the if you conditionally show something.

6
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:32,300
I also get a computed property which calculates lower case title and then here I got this watch property

7
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,850
where I simply throw an alert whenever I click days show paragraph button.

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,970
So if I do this yeah we see this alert we see this is updated.

9
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:47,540
We saw that alert as a sign up because we were watching the title and the title changed when clicking

10
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,010
this.

11
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,320
So this code doesn't do anything.

12
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,430
We haven't seen yet.

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,610
It's just a little collection of things we saw in this section.

14
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,440
I want to focus on this instance though.

15
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,040
We got all these properties l data map that's computed.

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:09,800
And that really is what makes up a beauteous application and what makes up a new instance the instance

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:16,590
kind of is the middleman between our Dom our HMO code up there and our business logic.

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:24,500
We pack all our business logic into this instance ever in the data property if it's simply some data

19
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,310
we want to work with B that set it initially or change for the application.

20
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,550
Be that a method which you want to call.

21
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:36,410
For example when clicking a button where we don't want to interact with our data and change it like

22
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:43,730
here and the methods property where we set up such methods or be that dependency or more complex operations

23
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:49,050
where we depend on the bell you all number property like here in the computed property.

24
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:55,640
These are the options on the View instance you already learn about for the last modules.

25
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,490
And that again is what composes your view instance and composes your application which allows you to

26
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,430
pick the right tool for the right task using the chase and setting it all up.

27
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:13,220
In this instance while there are two things I haven't touched on at all for a good reason but now is

28
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,720
the time to do so.

29
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,470
The first thing is did you ever wonder if it could have more than just one new instance.

30
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:26,360
In the end we do hook up our view instance with this Al selector here to this day if Id wafty work to

31
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:32,240
stay with the idea app What if we would have a number def with a number ID.

32
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,940
Could we create a new instance.

33
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,790
The answer is yes I'll come back to this.

34
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:42,880
Let me first asked the second question can we access our view in Stenz from outside.

35
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:48,920
We do have all our logic inside this object be passed to the constructor here but could we access our

36
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,730
instance from outside.

37
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,090
The answer on this question is yes to you.

38
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,370
So let's look at these two questions in more detail now.

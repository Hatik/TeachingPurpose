1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,130
Well now did we.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:09,610
And last week you learned about this template option and that we can mount our instance like this.

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,210
Well we can continue with that thought.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,600
What if we wanted to create a reusable component.

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:21,040
Hugh Eleazer does template in multiple places because maybe it would be something more than chess Telo

6
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:26,300
let's say would be a complex template displaying something what you want to display in several places

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,190
on our page.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:36,860
Now if you want to do that well one thing we could do of course was we could simply say that we don't

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:47,960
want to append to a child to get element by free but instead all comment this out here for now and I'll

10
00:00:48,060 --> 00:01:00,520
at the Al ref here again to select Let's say every thing which has this selector of Hello.

11
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:07,970
So this element of course doesn't exist but I'm trying to replace the template of every hello element

12
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,870
with this template.

13
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,290
So let's insert some Hello elements here is one and then a one.

14
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,500
And of course this is no official HDMI element but let's see if this works.

15
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,660
If I hit Control enter it only replaces the first occurrence.

16
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,070
What if we changed it to use the class hello.

17
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,970
If we didn't say div class hello like this.

18
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,590
And we repeat this

19
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,580
if I now enter also only one hello.

20
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,730
And if I remove both of them as well as is unnecessary death here.

21
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,880
Well then there is no halo of course.

22
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:57,300
So this does not work with this element it only takes the first one so I'll revert does but it would

23
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,460
still be nice to have such a reusable component wouldn't it.

24
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:09,240
Well we can create such a component and I can create it by simply going up there and registering one

25
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,870
with the new component.

26
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,030
This allows me to create a new component which can then reuse in all my Alber view instances and all

27
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,400
the templates of these instances.

28
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,830
The component takes as a first argument the selector of the component.

29
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,470
Let's name it.

30
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,280
Hello.

31
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,560
And the second argument is a challenge of object which is similar to the object we passed to have you

32
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,730
instance but not equal.

33
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,840
For example data is used differently.

34
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,050
And I'll come back to that in the component section in this course where we will delve much deeper into

35
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,590
components and learn how we can utilize them much better then by doing so.

36
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,930
But these are the first steps with them so I will show you how to use it like this.

37
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,590
So let's have a template.

38
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:58,700
Where are we now again have this H-1 Hello element here which I want to reuse.

39
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:05,830
And now I can use discompose and I treat it here I registered it globally by running view component

40
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,720
so I can now use it everywhere.

41
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:14,090
For example here in app 2 because free will get replaced with its own template entirely.

42
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:19,030
So that would not be a good example but an app too we don't do that so let's enter Hello here.

43
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:26,390
This new element which is the default element but the one we just created and indeed we see halo over

44
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,600
there and if I enter a number.

45
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,110
Hello.

46
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,100
In this apt to death.

47
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,430
Well then we see two ELO's and the third one is on the from the third instance down here.

48
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:43,730
So that we now get a reusable component with its own template using the same template property as we

49
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,240
do down here.

50
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:52,310
But now utilizing us or giving us the possibility to use that all over the place in our application

51
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,850
now that has some limitations and outcome come to these limitations in the next video and especially

52
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:04,730
in the components section where we dive deeper into that and learn how to really use components and

53
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,750
how we can utilize them better than we're doing here.

54
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,880
But it is important for you to take away.

55
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,910
There is a way to create such reusable parts in your application to give them their own templates to

56
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:22,610
give them their own select or buy which you can then enter them that again of course has no built in

57
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:29,630
select or hello doesn't exist there is no halo element we just told view chairs who replace every hello

58
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:36,830
element with this template and how it differs to a normal view instance where only the first occurrence

59
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:43,040
is replaced and where we can use it as a reusable selector with the component we can.

60
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,800
But again we'll delve deeper into this in the components section that I'll get rid of it here.

61
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,420
So that we revert to the no component state again and can continue with that.

00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:08,900
If you want to dive super hard core into all the available properties and so on on VHS and keep in mind

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,910
I will cover a lot of them throughout the course.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,190
It's not like we're at the end here.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:19,700
Not at all but if you want to dive into that future master or slash API is for you here you can find

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,400
all the properties on The View instance accessible from outside what you can set to the constructor

6
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,750
and much more.

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:32,290
And again I wouldn't go into there and think what I have never seen most of the stuff.

8
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:32,650
Yeah.

9
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:38,780
As I said I will cover much more fruit of course and it does make sense to give you the full API reference

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,800
at the beginning.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,570
Go through it step by step but you don't understand at all.

12
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,230
All of that is connected well.

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,780
If you are interest in that though this referendum is for you anyway.

14
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,970
It's a good resource if you want to look something up or are not 100 percent certain about a certain

15
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:53,510
topic.

16
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,260
I want to read more about it on the official docs.

1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:08,080
Let's first focus on using multiple instances here we get is death with the idea app.

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:17,360
Now the simplest thing is to simply copy this death and treat a new one named app to rename the first

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:25,050
one to app one all rename the selector here the element Ted the element property there for here to at

4
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:32,660
one or change it to app 1 and then I can simply scroll down and create a new view instance below the

5
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,510
first one.

6
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,110
So does this in normal Schulthess crypt code.

7
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:41,250
And here I set up this as selector selecting app to with the hash tag.

8
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:47,290
And now on to delete everything but title to Chesed showed that it works.

9
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:55,190
I'll set up a new data property or my new instance and there I will save to title the second instance

10
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,470
if I now hit Control enter.

11
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,300
We see the second instance on the right too.

12
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:07,060
So it's perfectly fine to control multiple pieces on your page with multiple instances.

13
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:13,790
Be aware though that of course inside of an instance you can only access the properties of that specific

14
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,710
instance with the this keyword.

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,850
So in the first instance here if I access this title here this of course will always refer to the title

16
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:28,590
in the data property of this instance here and not to the title in the second instance.

17
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,360
There is no connection between the two instances.

18
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:38,040
These are two separate kind of beauteous apps if you want to call them or basically just different.

19
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,590
You chase instances controlling different parts of your dorm.

20
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:49,250
It's perfectly fine to use this set up and actually you will see this in real applications where you

21
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:55,070
don't want to create a complex single page application using the chaps but only one to throw in some

22
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:00,620
widgets let's say let's say you want to create your own calendar which it then you could place your

23
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:06,860
calendar named Dave ideologue's calendar control with you chaps and then you might on the same page

24
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,780
have a number which to where.

25
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,970
For example you have some tabs to click through and display different content and you could create a

26
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,640
new instance for this.

27
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,290
So that is perfectly fine.

28
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:23,960
You may have multiple instances for different tasks as long as this is the key as long as there is no

29
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:31,100
connection between them if you need to call the function from one instance from number instance why

30
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:37,790
Lou will soon see that there technically will be a possible as you do so I recommend putting it all

31
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:43,600
into one instance because well it seems to belong to Gabr from a business logic perspective anyways

32
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,240
right.

33
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:49,700
But if that's not the case you're perfectly fine to use multiple instances just like dead.

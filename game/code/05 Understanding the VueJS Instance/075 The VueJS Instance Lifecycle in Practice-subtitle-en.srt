1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,320
We learned about all these lifecycle hooks and The Last Lecture.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,070
Now let's see them in action.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:14,280
We can easily execute some code at different points of the lifecycle by adding them here functions tudy

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,300
Optik we're passing to the view instance.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:23,440
So to review instance basically the first one is before create so we can at the before before create

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,070
function like this.

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:30,280
And here I will simply cancel LOC before create so we can see we to this hook.

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,640
You might of course execute any other code you need to execute there.

9
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,080
There after we have created.

10
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,770
So let's also add this function here.

11
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,100
And of course I shall also renamed this here to treat it.

12
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:51,930
Then we have before MT We now created this view Cheras instance but it hasn't been mounted to the done

13
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:52,390
yet.

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,430
So it is yet to be reflected on what we see in the browser.

15
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:04,980
Thereafter of course we have mounted now mounted as the name implies means now it is attached to our

16
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:05,790
real Dom.

17
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,020
We can see it in the browser.

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:16,050
Now if some data changes we have before update which is executed right before the dom or the part which

19
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:23,130
needs to be updated in a dorm is re rendered and then we get updated which as you might guess is called

20
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,610
right after this part of the bomb has been updated.

21
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:35,010
And then when it comes to it and for our instance we get the destroy it which is called right before

22
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,220
the instance.

23
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:42,600
Well yeah like you guess is removed so it's destroyed not only removed it is destroyed.

24
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,370
And finally at the very end we got destroyed.

25
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,810
This would be a hook where it's good to do some cleanup work or before destroy hook.

26
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,450
To be precise to do some cleanup work if you need to release some resources or anything like that.

27
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,750
This is the whole cycle.

28
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,390
Now we could already see some of these functions but not all to be able to see before update and updated.

29
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:10,460
We need to implement something which changes something and to see before destroy and destroy.

30
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:14,940
We need to implement some code to actually destroy this instance.

31
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,450
I'll do both with buttons here.

32
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:26,140
The first button should say update title and all I want to do here is on a click listener.

33
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:35,750
I simply want to set the title equal to changed and then I will add a button where I say destroy it.

34
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:45,670
And here I went to call the destroy method let's say which I'll add down here in the methods property

35
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,890
that's important to realize all these lifecycle hooks are not inside the methods property.

36
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:56,930
These are all functions registered directly on the root object be passed to the constructor.

37
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:05,430
So in the methods property here I will set up destroy which is of course a function where I will call

38
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:10,430
this referring to this view instance and then destroy with a dollar sign at the beginning.

39
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,050
This will destroy this instance.

40
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,130
Well let's see it in action by opening up the console hitting control enter to re-enter this.

41
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:24,530
And we already see before create created before mount and mount it which makes sense.

42
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,190
These are the first hooks get which get executed in this order.

43
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:35,520
Now let me hit update title and you'll see that before update an updated was executed of course because

44
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,840
this is what we did.

45
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,010
We updated something we update at a property we update at a property which required the dorm to be changed

46
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,050
and hence we saw before update and updated.

47
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,110
Interesting.

48
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:53,750
If I hit update Tyla again it will set tile to change again which is to value the title already has

49
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:03,160
see that no method gets executed now because as I explained in the how does view as updated Dom lecture.

50
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:11,220
It doesn't do this if there is no real change to be taken care of it recognize us dead even though we.

51
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,570
Yes touched is title property.

52
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,020
We didn't change the value it's the same value as before.

53
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,450
Hence no need to rerun or anything.

54
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:25,200
Hence no need to call either before update nor updated.

55
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:31,490
And finally let's destroyed by hitting the destroy button and you see before destroy and destroy.

56
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:39,440
Got called and now the changed text is still here but it's not longer control by future as the future

57
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,560
instance is gone and no longer available.

58
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:48,650
So every Abaroa code we would have here all these buttons will no longer work and I can't prove this

59
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,690
by resetting it.

60
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,660
Call control again and hit update title you see even though we now read it you should see an update

61
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,590
because the text isn't different one then changed.

62
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,250
It doesn't work because the view chair's instance is dead.

63
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,390
This does not mean that it removes all the code from the dharma as you can clearly see it only means

64
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,900
it removes all the javascript logic.

65
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:19,120
So all our connections are now dead and this is the view as life cycle and a tiny bit of how Boucek

66
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:26,170
is updates Saddam Dom with the before update and update at Moffats year in action.

67
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,160
With that let's move on to more practice driven modules.

68
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:37,110
But that was a core module to understand how chess works behind the scenes and how you may utilize it.

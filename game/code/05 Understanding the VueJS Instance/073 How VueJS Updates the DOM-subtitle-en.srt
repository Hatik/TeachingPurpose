1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:08,050
One important part of understanding Duchessa is to understand how it handles changes so how it detects

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,490
that change has occurred and how it then updates the page because neander does what it's doing it's

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,500
not really loading it it's updating parts of it for a script.

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,860
We have to view instance on one side and the bomb on the site.

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:26,290
I already explained that Devu instance creates and holds a template ever derived from the age HTML code

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,490
or past to have the template property in this template we might have a message where we say hello.

7
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,130
And there's of course also is represented in the dorm.

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,600
After it has been rendered and you might have other properties used in the dorm were used not a template

9
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,670
like this but then finally being printed or painted to dawn.

10
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:52,420
Now what if we changed a message we could think that you chest constantly what's just a message sent.

11
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,580
Updates darm if required.

12
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,010
The first part is right.

13
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:02,650
Each property we set up has its own watcher and I explained this earlier that you chase when we pass

14
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:08,350
an object to the constructor creates these watchers for all the properties in our data property thus

15
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:15,070
allowing us or thus allowing itself to watch for changes to just properties which announce or which

16
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:19,870
means that it probably needs to update something but it's not updating like dead.

17
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,970
It's not constantly updating everything and there are real Dombeck just because it changed.

18
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:33,220
Think of this if we changed message and set it to how low again then technically we touched this property.

19
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:39,400
We changed it but we changed it to the same value as before it would render the part of the dom or worst

20
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:45,070
of all it may be the complete Dom and that would be a real performance hit because accessing the real

21
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,400
Dom is the part which takes the most performance.

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,400
Javascript is super fast but accessing the Dharma's super slow.

23
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,210
So we want to do this as seldom as possible.

24
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,020
Hence this is not what it does neber for master nor for any other property.

25
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,480
Instead it has an extra layer the work till dawn and on the virtual Dom.

26
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:14,110
This is a representation of the real Dom kind of a copy but a copy parsed Inshalla script and therefore

27
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:23,260
very very quick to be accessed viewed S10 simply checks DS or watches IDs changes writes them to does

28
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,360
virtual Dom.

29
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,530
If we update message for example to Hello everyone even though it might have been set to Hello everyone

30
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,810
before it it recreates does virtual.

31
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:39,250
And then it takes the difference between the template and the virtual Dom and only updates this part.

32
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,540
In the real dawn so it knows which property did change.

33
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,420
Which part of template disaffected What is the current state of the Dawn represented by the word chill

34
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,080
Dom.

35
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:56,320
OK I got this heading here or just paragraph or whatever which actually needs to be updated.

36
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:02,270
And now it goes out to the actual Dom to the real Dom and changes this paragraph.

37
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:08,620
And since it also updated D word trolldom it now automatically got an up to date representations of

38
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:14,560
the real Dom without having to take a full copy of that again because again it constantly updates this.

39
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,110
Does this how does change detection with the Watchers and updating with the word show on works which

40
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,750
makes future as very performant and very fast.

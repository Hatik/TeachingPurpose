1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:08,610
So in the last video we already ran NPM run build this script here which is key to creators just folder

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,660
with the built js file.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:18,030
It bundles all the files from the source folder together into one bundle which holds all your code.

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:24,660
Now this entry in this age him fall needs to be deployed in this a Web pack simple template as well

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,480
as the Obert templates created by the UCLA.

6
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:33,120
Everything's already configured to be deployment ready if you're not using them.

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,940
Let's have a look at the web page config file.

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:44,370
The important parts your Ardis define plug in where we basically set the mode to production year which

9
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:50,100
will strip out some additional warnings if you chest would throw otherwise this will reduce default

10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,680
size because we don't need the warnings anymore.

11
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:59,430
And it also makes sure that your deployed application doesn't give some implausibly meaningful warnings

12
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,110
to visitors of your page.

13
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,770
You don't want to do that.

14
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:09,630
Then we also have the optimize plug in your D Actually Veitch's Yes plug in which many flies everything

15
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:16,490
which means shortens your words makes everything more compact so that it works great.

16
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,100
Now with these two steps in place warnings stripped out and everything many find again it is just done

17
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,980
automatically by the template set up through the Seelye.

18
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,300
We're ready to deploy our app.

19
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,810
So now that we have this built chairs file and in this age to all fall we get everything we need.

20
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,020
Let's now see how we can actually deploy it.

21
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,110
And I will show this as an example of Amazon Web Services ASP free.

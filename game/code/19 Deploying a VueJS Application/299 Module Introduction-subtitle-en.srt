1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,140
We get her finished application.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,940
Now we probably all want to deploy it.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,850
So it is the application running in development mode.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,140
Now if we have a look at our application here and the center does this the terminal where I run this

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,770
we don't only have access to does NPM run def command be able to get the package done Jason where all

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,750
our scripts we can run through NPM are stored.

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:31,860
Ed we see we're having the DAPH command which we used all the time but we also have deep belt Command

8
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,650
which runs the production workflow.

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,810
So with NPM run build we're not starting a development server.

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,850
Instead we're preparing the whole project for deployment.

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,630
Therefore this process will not keep running it finishes because no server was started but this will

12
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,880
give us a new folder.

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:57,000
The disk folder which holds our build cheapass file the file we will need to deploy together with our

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,840
index h him a file to make our application work on a server.

15
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:08,430
Now in this module I will show you how to prepare your application for deployment.

16
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,250
And then finally deploy it.

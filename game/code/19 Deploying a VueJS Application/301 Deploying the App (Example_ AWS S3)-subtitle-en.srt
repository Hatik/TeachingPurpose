1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,880
I mean the AWOS con..

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:10,960
If AWOS Amazon Web Services is all new to you simply google for it and make sure to get into it.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,480
Basically you'll need to create an account on Amazon Web services you can use your normal Amazon account

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,410
if you want.

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,620
And after logging it in you should see this console here.

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:27,620
Now here's a very important disclaimer what I'm showing your will be free of charge.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:34,360
If this is a new Amazon Web Services account within the 12 month you get everything or you get a lot

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,840
for free trial period.

9
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:42,700
Now you definitely have to check if these conditions still apply at the point of time you're watching

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,510
this with you.

11
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:50,740
So if using Amazon Web Services as free as we will do is still free and you will also need to make sure

12
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:58,180
that you're not using Avars services which might lead to more services being used higher volumes being

13
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:03,230
used than are free so that you get possible charges you don't want to get.

14
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:08,050
Now with that disclaimer out of the way which basically is have a look at what you're doing here.

15
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,700
I will show you how to deploy it here.

16
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:17,520
Now the steps I show you here will generally be the same on any hosting provider you choose.

17
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,030
It's very simple.

18
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:26,200
So I will use Asprey which is its cloud storage service but this also allows you to host single page

19
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:31,180
applications static applications where you don't need to run any server side code.

20
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,820
And we don't need to do that here.

21
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,230
So click on Esrey there.

22
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,060
And once you're there you want to create a new bucket.

23
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,340
Now you see I already have some pockets but that's no problem.

24
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,470
I'll create a new one here.

25
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:55,220
Choose any region and view chaos deploy here so hit create your and this will give you this new bucket.

26
00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:00,410
Now there are a couple of things we need to set up here to enable laid for web site hosting.

27
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:06,080
Most important here static web site and hosting we want it and able there is of course.

28
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:13,210
And our next document will be the index HVM or file as will be the error document important.

29
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:19,570
We need to set our error document to index H.J. email to make sure that in case of floor or for error

30
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,580
us we're getting back our index.

31
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,330
Tim all I discussed is or outing section.

32
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,420
This is important Amr wise.

33
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,000
The routes we have in our fronted application will not be recognized.

34
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:38,010
So make sure to set it up like this now here let's say it's safe to use safety changes.

35
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:44,000
Now with that we're able to there's static website deployment but we also need to edit the permissions

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,450
to make sure that people are able to view this web page there.

37
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:54,290
We want to add a packet policy and now for the pulse to use we can simply google for Amerson static

38
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,690
web page.

39
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:01,430
A.W. aesthetic web page where you find an example article or walking through the required steps.

40
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:07,940
And if you scroll down there you will see the configure your buckets step which gives you this permission

41
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,800
you should copy into your bucket policy here.

42
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:17,870
So copied in here and now there you need to place example dot com with your bucket.

43
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,450
So this is huge yes deploy in my case here.

44
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:27,280
And then you may save here and now you could also enable logging as you see your bot.

45
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,490
I don't want to do this here instead we'll jump to deploying the web page now.

46
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:38,510
Now the blogging the web page will need us to create the index a share of all we already do have this.

47
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,410
And now we may upload the files we want to upload here.

48
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,740
Well that is very simple.

49
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,840
We now go to our bucket here and there we simply click on it.

50
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,710
And click upload.

51
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,450
Now here we want to add the files to upload.

52
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:03,730
Make sure to navigate to your beauteous folder here and upload the next HD file and thereafter also

53
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,600
the Belchers fall into this folder.

54
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,600
And now this is a step which is the same floor no matter where you host your files.

55
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:19,890
You need to ship these two files to your page to the hosting service where you're hosting your application.

56
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,870
So you may start upload thereafter.

57
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,280
And is already done since it isn't that big.

58
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:33,390
Now if you files uploaded you need to create a folder name it dist and move your bold js file to that

59
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,120
folder.

60
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:40,920
So your you basically 1-A coded here Klegg into that folder and paste it in here.

61
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,220
So of that you now set up the same folder structure you had locally that you can build back to old buckets.

62
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:54,290
You do properties of your future as deploy a bucket and hit the end point off your page to now see your

63
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,380
page running on the Internet.

64
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,140
This is how you deploy it on Amazon it's free.

65
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:09,230
And again it's the same on any service upload the HMO file anti Boccaccio's bundle in your folder in

66
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,360
the disk folder and it should run like this again.

67
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:19,560
Also make sure to redirect all for for errors to your index HMO volved so that you can handle this.

68
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,630
And this is our deployed app.

69
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:26,890
Now you can follow through the steps in this deployment guide on AWOS here.

70
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:33,930
If you all want to set up Cloud front to optimize the distribution and also set up dynamically sipping

71
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:39,110
to compress the files when when they are transferred or if you're applying it somewhere else.

72
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,650
Definitely have a look at the specific configurations.

73
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,920
Your host might need but this is how easy it is.

74
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:52,160
Again key part prepare it for deployment by stripping out the warnings and modifying it and then upload

75
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,580
it next HVM out and that this folder with the bundle.

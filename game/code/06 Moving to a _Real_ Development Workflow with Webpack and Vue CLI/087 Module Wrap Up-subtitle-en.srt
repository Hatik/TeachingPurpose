00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:09,820
So and this model we have a detailed look at the UCL I hope we can use it to create better workflows

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,870
based on some templates which are available for the rest of the course.

3
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:20,590
I will use the web page simple template and especially important feature Arty's dot viewfinders.

4
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:28,300
These single template files which houses a template the script and styles all in one file that's a special

5
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:35,770
concept you chairs off resew which makes writing your view instances or components a lot more convenient

6
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,400
and gives you some additional power.

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:45,550
Therefore for the rest of the course I will use this template this well-packed simple template we set

8
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:53,350
up in this module Ebele ustedes signal template files these Dodik view files to continue working with

9
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,210
that.

10
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58,570
Definitely consider using such a workflow for your projects.

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,970
Possibly the web back instead of the Web Picks simple workflow we're using here.

12
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:08,980
And with that you should have a powerful tool to really create bigger applications.

00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:07,050
Well last week we had a look at why you might want to use and develop and workflow and what that actually

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,470
is we could set up such a word on our own.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,470
You could use web pack if you were familiar with that.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:19,140
And there we have the view loader to say that right away which is a package allowing us to for example

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,450
transform such single file templates but we don't have to set it up on our own.

6
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,570
And actually in this course we won't do that.

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:35,170
We will use the used seal and seal eyes sounds like a big powerful many feature tool but actually useful.

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,490
I have one major task.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:46,290
It allows us to fetch view chairs project templates which means to fetch certain projects setups which

10
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:53,400
are empty but which have a process set up and you can dive into such a process of course to kind of

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,540
tweak it and to adjust to your needs or to find out how to set up your own.

12
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,490
We can install the Seelye with that command it's very easy and that installs and Clovelly on our machine.

13
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,100
On Mac you will have to follow sudo in front of data on Linux too.

14
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,220
And then we have access to a multitude of available templates.

15
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,570
For example here the simple template that is basically the same we use to.

16
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,160
Yes.

17
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,060
It's a nix aged him out file and then the script import from a CDN.

18
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,950
But we also have a simple web peg workflow that is the one we'll use in this course.

19
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:32,910
It has a nice web page workflow which will recompile our single file templates which allows us to use

20
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:40,460
ESX all these nice things has really two things we need and gives us a nice production ready application.

21
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:46,620
Now if you want a big package with testing and all these outward and next level features you could also

22
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:53,130
use the web spec workflow which will include stat and which is more powerful but a bit overkill for

23
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,100
discourse where I don't want to dive into seeis as processing or testing.

24
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,540
I want to focus on future as we understand and learn VHS.

25
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:08,040
You also could use browser VI templates if you prefer that were well-packed but we will use web Pegasus

26
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:15,570
as kind of the cool kid in the world of front and web development right now regarding the template compilation

27
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,090
I was talking about earlier.

28
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:23,280
All templates except the simple one support is so that we have these single file templates compiled

29
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:29,820
to our code our javascript template so that we can have this improved runtime configuration with the

30
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,980
smaller view chairs package and the better performance.

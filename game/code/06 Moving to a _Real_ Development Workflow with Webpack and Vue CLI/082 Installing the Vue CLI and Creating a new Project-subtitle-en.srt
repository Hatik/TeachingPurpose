1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:07,750
Well that was a lot of talking let's install these Selye Eleazar Adamek we will have to write sudo on

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,380
windows you don't need this and then NPM.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,120
And what is NPM NPM missed the node package manager.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,330
So for this to work you will need to install node J.S..

5
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,300
You don't need no chest because you are going to write any node Jasc code.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,600
We're not going to write any node code.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,320
We're not going to write our own server side code.

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,250
We will need it.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:35,860
So slowly for now four days node package manager which is the de-facto tool to use for front end development

10
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,810
to manage your dependencies so we will definitely need this.

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:46,270
And also because this development server which will be included in the template we're using so we don't

12
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,200
have to write it on our own but it will still use no chance to run.

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,560
So we need for this too.

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,300
So make sure to download the current Worsham thirty six point eight point in one word.

15
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,290
In this case well at the time I record this video.

16
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:05,440
But the latest one you see here and then downloaded run Freudians Stolar and after it finishes you will

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,810
have no genius installed and you're ready to use NPM and no chairs for the server.

18
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,620
And then you can continue here.

19
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:19,380
So sudo NPM and then install minus g to install it locally on your machine.

20
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,070
View.

21
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:28,600
Seelye now after hitting enter all have to enter my password here and that will pull down and install

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,050
the Seelye on my machine and I'll be back once it is finished.

23
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:39,470
Now that the installation did finish I can get into the folder where I want to store my project full

24
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:45,440
the way I went to create my view Seelye project or my view Jasp project and I can then do this by simply

25
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,420
running the view.

26
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,630
This is a whaleboat since we just installed the U.S. ally.

27
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:56,540
And then which template I want to use so which template of my project I want to use.

28
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:02,690
If we have a look at the official Bucy I get her page you can find it by googling for view Seelye.

29
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:09,180
You will also find the explanations here but you will also find your way allowable templates I was mentioning

30
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,370
on these slides earlier.

31
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,360
So I'll just wet Peggs simple set up which has everything we need for discourse.

32
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,880
So here it's all about writing the you need to initialize a new project then the template you want to

33
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,980
use which is where simple.

34
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,180
And then the project full you want to create.

35
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,730
I'm going to name my views Seelye this name is totally up to you.

36
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:34,230
Now after hitting enter this will set up this project as you will see it will use the two point X version

37
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,730
by default which is what you want if you wanted to use view 1 point x.

38
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,420
You have to add that teched is hash tag after the template.

39
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:49,960
So I will confirm the default project name default description as well as my name here.

40
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,270
And then we're done.

41
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:57,540
So now let's follow these commands and entered the Seelye folder we just created with that.

42
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,840
And then we have to run NPM install to pull down all the dependencies dys needs because this just created

43
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,740
the template with the package daat Jason and indice package.

44
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,830
Jason File.

45
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:14,820
That's our dependency management files or to say all the dependencies of this project are listed and

46
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,300
we're installing all these dependencies here.

47
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,310
That being said there is almost only development only dependencies.

48
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,000
The only production dependency should be viewed as the rest will be web peg and so on quite a bit.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,690
As you can see it.

50
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,460
But no worries.

51
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,130
We don't do deep we don't need to deploy all of them as I just said.

52
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,580
Most of them are only needed for development.

53
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:40,990
So going back up we see that thereafter we should run NPM run Deppe inside this project folder.

54
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,420
So let's do this and this will start the development server.

55
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:50,460
We can use and it will keep running so keep this process running and will automatically recompile everything

56
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,990
and reload our server automatically whenever we change a file.

57
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:00,960
So let's wisit this you are Ehle here in case it didn't open up automatically which it did here and

58
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,450
you should see this starting page.

59
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:08,310
Now that's just a little starting page which shipped with the template of course we're going to edit

60
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,500
this and this is what we'll do next.

61
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,940
Have a look at the folder structure which was created and how we can work with that project.

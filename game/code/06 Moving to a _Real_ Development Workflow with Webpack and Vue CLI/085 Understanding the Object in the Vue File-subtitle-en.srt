1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:10,610
The important thing to know here is that whatever we export here this object is of view instance or

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:16,140
is the same object we use in a view instance we will later on use this as a component.

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:22,940
We can use it like here with the render function to render that it is used as a view instance and therefore

4
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,860
it has the same properties.

5
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,500
So we can set up methods where we can set up a computer there.

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,890
We all can set up data there but I'll come back today that because there's something special about using

7
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:34,740
data there.

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,160
So the key takeaway is this object behaves like a view instance as a side note.

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,850
You don't have to export this using this file like this is fine too.

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:50,240
It will work as you can see here we see Hello world still because the script is not required but it

11
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:54,420
is required if you want to attach some business logic to this template.

12
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:59,890
And if you for example want to use stringin to Appalachian there well then you would hear in this object

13
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,580
set up your data field with the data properties you want to import into plate and so on.

14
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,560
So this is how this file works.

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,850
And what's so important to understand about it.

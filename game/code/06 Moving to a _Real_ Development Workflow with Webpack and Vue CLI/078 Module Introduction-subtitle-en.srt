1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,110
Until now we have worked in chairs.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,220
Fiddle Well maybe you follow along on your local set up as I showed it in the first section of this

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,070
course.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:17,310
But no matter if you did that or if we use that that is really just a set up which works for very simple

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,850
and small applications like the app we built before.

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,460
It's not a set up you when we use for medium sized or certainly not for big projects.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,370
So in this course module will do the translation.

8
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:37,080
We all take the basics we learn thus far all the basics about view chairs and now we'll put them into

9
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,990
work in bigger projects or in medium sized projects to begin with to do that.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,400
We need a different set up.

11
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,730
We'll move away from Che's Fedele.

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,780
It's great for showcasing basic things but we're leaving this world now.

13
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,420
Now we want to dive into components into building bigger applications.

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:01,730
Building our application up from different parts and pieces and for debt we will need a more elaborate

15
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:06,200
process which sounds bigger than it is but we need some additional tools.

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,050
We need some additional features and chase fiddle just doesn't offer them.

17
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,990
Especially it will get more and more different to kind of understand what's going on if you only have

18
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,290
this small of an editor.

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:25,230
So with that in this march we'll have a look at which workflow is we could use when using or when working

20
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,190
with you just how Mujeres supports us with that.

21
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,710
And what's so special about these workflows.

22
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,500
Let's dive in.

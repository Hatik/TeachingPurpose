1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:07,380
Need to wrap up there's part here about the VCL Sea-Lion and there's template we're using here for the

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,710
rest of the course.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,140
You also got a novel script besides NPM run death which we use before and that is NPM run built.

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,940
Now this will build it for production which means it will now actually create the disk folder as you

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,580
can see which holds your bundle and it will also have some optimizations in place there.

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,880
So many fly it as you can see it's magnified now and so on.

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,830
So this is how you want to run this command.

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:38,190
If you actually want to deploy your application also feel free to play around with the other templates

9
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,850
but that was the basic introduction to it.

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,940
This will be the template we'll use for the rest of the course.

11
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,370
And with that see you in the section about component's.

1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:06,300
Now let's finish up this module by having a look at the submit button here.

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,740
Right now we're not using it.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,530
I'm always displaying all the data down there.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,670
Now I want to simply hook up this submit button.

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,140
So I want to add a click listener to it.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:23,460
And on this click listener I will add pre-event to prevent inform submission because this button here

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,490
is the only button in my form element.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,160
And if you get a button in a form element it will by default once you hit it submit that form to the

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:32,670
server.

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,450
Now we don't want to do that because our server is not the place where we want to handle it.

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,990
We want to hand lead with view.

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:38,940
Yes.

13
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:43,860
Therefore do you prevent modify mixture of it not sending a request to the server instead we prevent

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,200
this default behavior and let you chase handle that.

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,350
So a year I will simply add event or method.

16
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,410
I want to execute submitted.

17
00:00:52,650 --> 00:01:00,590
And then I need to add this here to my methods property or object down there in my view instance here

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,940
I got my submitted method and here I simply want to say it is submitted Of course I have to create this

19
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,970
property to True.

20
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,390
That means that here I can now create a new property or I have to create this new property which is

21
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:20,660
set to false initially and I want to use this property to conditionally show or not yield this data

22
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:21,290
panel.

23
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:29,720
So this whole row here I will add the if here I can simply check if it is submitted that will be a boolean

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,660
true or false.

25
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:35,560
And if it is false like it is initially we shouldn't see that data field only after we hit the button.

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,720
Should we see it.

27
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,430
So if safe doesn't go back.

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,970
We indeed see the data field is gone.

29
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,300
Now let's enter some data in our input here.

30
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:50,050
And if I hit submit we see up here down there with the data we add it.

31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,690
And with this we can still update it of course because this is how does this set up.

32
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,060
But now we're able to use that reset button.

33
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,390
Very important here.

34
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,670
The pre-event option year which makes sure I'm not submitting it to the server.

35
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,940
And then we can go from there and handle our data in the submitted method.

1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:07,620
Now what I did behind the scenes since this is not really about the stylings I created this switch Capone

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,550
and now you will find the code attached to this lecture.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,520
But I will quickly walk you through that of course in the template.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,910
I suddenly have two divs.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,790
One has the ID one on excuse me and one has the idea off both as a click listener whereas simply toggle

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:27,780
is on to True or false depending on which as which I click well and then I add a class which is the

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,920
active class.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,100
And this depends on whether it's on is true or false depending on which switch we are.

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:40,260
And then down there I have a couple of styles on and off my two boxes basically got a with a white background

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,850
color some padding.

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,920
I want to display them in lamp locked and have him sit next to each other and negative margin to left

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,550
and right to have them sit directly on each other at some box sizing make the cursor a pointer and centered

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,110
a text.

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,550
And then I got this active class which has the same effect as when they hover over a switch Well light

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:00:59,960
green.

16
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:05,830
In the case of the on switch and light Curle indicate of the off switch.

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,850
Then I went to the Apter view file where I simply imported the switch up here and added it as a local

18
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,240
component here in the components property.

19
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:21,150
That of course allows me to use it in my template there where I inserted this row right below the select

20
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:21,990
dropdown.

21
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,180
So this is an old bootstrap row with the same column class as we had before.

22
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,750
And then my custom input.

23
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,730
Now I don't have any input related logic there that's just the styling.

24
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,110
It leads to this layout.

25
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,970
We got on an off switch here.

26
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,020
However I'm not able to listen to that.

27
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,770
I'm not able to set a value.

28
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,100
This is what we'll work on together.

29
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,600
So let's make this component more than just some optical sugar.

30
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,500
Let's actually turn it into a real control we can use.

31
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:59,090
I want to use it here with a new component where I simply say data switch and set this to true by default.

32
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:04,360
Now I want to be able to use these on my custom component.

33
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:11,600
I added here by adding the model to it and binding to data switch into a shell pass.

34
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,530
True or false or react to changes in this component.

35
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:21,560
Now as I explained earlier that means that I have to set up the value prop in my component and emit

36
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,470
input event.

37
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,840
So let's work on this next.

38
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,880
I want to set up the value prop and to input event in switch component.

39
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:36,170
So to do so I will go to my object export here and I will add my props and this will be an array and

40
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,940
I know that I should be able to handle value because this is what the model will give me in the end

41
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,160
these values shall be true or false.

42
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,590
I could add proper validation here.

43
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,210
I'll leave it simple like that and then I want to use value.

44
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,810
Now how do I want to use value in this component here though.

45
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,840
Well I no longer want to use is on here.

46
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:07,520
I can actually remove this instead here I want to use value and said value to True or false here.

47
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:12,550
And also check value here because this is my new it is on property.

48
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,570
This will be true or false.

49
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,680
Passed from outside but that is changeable from inside.

50
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,710
So you're able to use it and change it.

51
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,510
Now of course I also need to submit an event.

52
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,650
So here when clicking setting value to True or false is not really all I need.

53
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:36,060
Instead I should use my methods objects here to simply add the so which method let's say.

54
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,330
Or since as is the reserve name let's use switched.

55
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,000
So here I want to output switched and I want to pass.

56
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:50,060
True since as the on case and you don't want to use switched and pass false because you want to set

57
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,280
it to false.

58
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,340
So what I'll do here is I will simply emit with this emit.

59
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:01,010
We learnt that before a custom event and event has to have the name input because that is what the model

60
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,590
is waiting for.

61
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:11,880
And then here I can simply output Well the value I'm passing here on aim at is on again and I will pass

62
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,230
that on.

63
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:22,010
Now with this let's go back to our main component where we use our own switch and let's add a new paragraph

64
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:31,130
here where I will say switched to output the data switch property this data which property again is

65
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,930
bound to my custom component.

66
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,970
Let's see if this works how should we see true here.

67
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,030
And if I switch this to off it changes to false.

68
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:45,680
And with that we built our own control very very easily as you see by adding a new component which has

69
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,020
these two key features.

70
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,490
It has to have to work with we model.

71
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,920
It takes a prop of value and it emits an input event.

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,120
All the other logic inside this component is totally up to you.

73
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,550
This may be much more complex than just two deaths.

74
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,470
Of course this is up to you.

75
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:06,860
The key thing is that what you get in value and what you output the input event and with that you can

76
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,610
use your own components as controls in your foreigns awesome.

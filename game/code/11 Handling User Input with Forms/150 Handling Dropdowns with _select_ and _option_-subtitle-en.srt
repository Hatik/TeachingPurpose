00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:08,100
Well we all just finished our forum let's work on the last type of input here a select input a dropdown

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,590
the AGM all killed can be found here and here I want to do two things.

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,200
I of course want to use view just to get the value.

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:23,010
But I also want to view chess to populate this select distraught down with options you see right now.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,690
It's a normal select input here set up with some bootstrap styling.

6
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:32,940
And then we would add a couple of options like this of course options should also contain a bit more

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,740
information than just an opening and closing tag.

8
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:42,030
The reason why I only have an empty option here is that I want to add them dynamically so let it go

9
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,080
down into my data property and here I first want to add an array of options.

10
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:55,800
I want to populate my form with a name and priority T's so and a number of different priorities.

11
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:00,670
And here we get high medium and of course low.

12
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,570
So these are the three options I want to use.

13
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:10,330
Now do you use that as dial up to select here and the first thing I'll do is of course on my option

14
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:18,540
here I want to set up a for loop to loop through my priority in priorities like that priority is here

15
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,350
of course river to the priorities set up down there.

16
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,900
This will create all these options.

17
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:33,250
Now I can also add it here priority by simply outputting it like is westering and translation between

18
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,980
the opening and closing tag.

19
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:42,270
Now this will add a couple of options as we can already see here high medium and low.

20
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:49,170
Now of course you could select a number option by default by binding to the selected property de-selected

21
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:56,460
attribute of colon selected and then as a value for determining if this should be selected we could

22
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,290
simply check if priority.

23
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,760
So the value of the current loop iteration equals medium.

24
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,520
This is a string of single quotes.

25
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,970
Now this will when this reloads select medium by default and I of course can still switch to high or

26
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,460
low.

27
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:18,660
But now we change default by simply adding this property bind this attribute bind here with the colon

28
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,170
and the name of the attribute and then the logic which determines if that should be bound or not.

29
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,750
Because select that keep this in mind is an attribute which in the end once a true or false data field

30
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,010
so what it wants to know whether there should be a selected or not.

31
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,260
So the value passed to it has to be a condition giving us back true or false.

32
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,710
And I do this by checking if priority is mid medium.

33
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,910
So all structuralism are multiple lines so it's easier to read.

34
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,100
With that we set up our option.

35
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,110
Now of course I want to bind this input.

36
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,300
We're not doing that right now we're only populating it with values.

37
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,780
So how do I bind my select field here.

38
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
My select input control.

39
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,840
Of course we do that by using the model again.

40
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:05,390
Now important we modeless now not used on the individual option but on the overall control which is

41
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,490
select here.

42
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,040
So here again we use the model and a want to bind.

43
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:17,600
Well a new property or trade for that DB property I will create a simply name.

44
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:25,750
Say selected priority and I would set this too high by default

45
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:37,000
and now if I go back there and add selected priority as the model which binding and let this reload

46
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,120
you'll now see highest selected by default.

47
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:46,530
Yes I do have my check to override this but it is in the end written by the model were binding to.

48
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,740
So that's number way to set the default.

49
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:55,060
We do have our view model which has a default value select a proper priority and this will always override

50
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,360
whatever I said year was selected.

51
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:03,310
So selectable only work if we're not using the model here or if we're not pre-populated we model with

52
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,680
a default value.

53
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,110
So that's the reason why I will remove this code.

54
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,200
Keep in mind you could use it though if you don't have a default value.

55
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:17,270
And with that I set this up as I wanted with the default value of high selected.

56
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,300
Now this all of course means that it works the other way around so that if we change the selection we'll

57
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,720
update our property.

58
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:31,940
Therefore we can output a tier selector priority in this paragraph and with that finally can see why

59
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,630
down there.

60
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,360
If I changed it to low it changes there too as it does for a change to medium.

61
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,610
And that is the last type of input field I wanted to show you.

62
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,780
The last time a form control we have the dropdown de-select control here with that you learn about the

63
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:54,100
basic HDMI controls we do have and how to use view Che's to get the values to set the values to work

64
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,270
with them all the time using the model.

65
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:03,730
Now in the next hour you will have a look at how we can build our own input field our own form control

66
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,470
by using components.

67
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,590
So let's dive into that in the next video.

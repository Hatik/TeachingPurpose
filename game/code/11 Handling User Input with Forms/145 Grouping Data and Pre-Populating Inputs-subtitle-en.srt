1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,980
In the last lecture we started simple.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,160
We hooked up this male input field with our male property here in our view instance that is a great

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:12,640
start.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:18,520
It shows us that we use the model to connect our age team input with our property to web doing that

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,240
as I also explained that the future will magically updated correctly.

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:29,170
Now let's dive a bit deeper and let's say I don't only want to have this email property instead of want

7
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:35,860
to have a user data object here which then has the email field and what else have we got here.

8
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,020
We also get a password and age.

9
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,890
So when I grew up these three and puts year together so that we have them in one Optik down there.

10
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:49,630
So that would be the email here that will be the password and then that would be the age that should

11
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,190
be grouped together.

12
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:55,540
And therefore I can eat this and she'll actually be a string but a number.

13
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:01,690
And let's repopulate this with a default number 27 year that is my real age and I want to repopulate

14
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,260
the forum with that.

15
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:09,790
Now with that optic set up I can simply point to that by accessing my object here user data.

16
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,720
Email now.

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,760
Now I'm whining to a property in an object and that's perfectly valid.

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,900
I can now take this approach and also hook up my password with we model here to also store it in the

19
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,600
user data and then get in the password field.

20
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,830
And well for the age we want to do the same for the H.

21
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,590
We also want to hook this up to user data and then age.

22
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,560
In this case.

23
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:41,980
Now if I save this and we head over we see that age isn't indeed pre-populated with that 27 eyes set

24
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,890
up down there as a default value.

25
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,130
Now I can also fill out all the other fields of course.

26
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:53,260
And my secret password and well now we're not seeing it down there.

27
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:59,350
The reason for that of course simply is that I still use e-mail here but that changed to user data on

28
00:01:59,380 --> 00:01:59,800
email.

29
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,620
It's an object now and I'm not outputting it for password and age.

30
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,770
So let's do that user data.

31
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:14,150
Email and also output user data age year like that.

32
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,950
Now I save this and head back.

33
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,450
We now see the values populated in this data box down there.

34
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:29,160
This how we can use a more complex object to nest our properties and how to pre populate a field by

35
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,560
simply setting the property initially.

36
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,330
Now as you will see I can of course overwrite those.

37
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,950
If I set this to 30 30 then there too.

38
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,730
So this is how we can use this set of.

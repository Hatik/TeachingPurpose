1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:04,630
The Last Lecture we use the default value for H.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,230
And we also nest our properties.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:14,870
Now let's dive a bit deeper into how we can modify the way the model works with these inputs.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:21,590
Right now the data down there is updated with each keystroke and I can prove this by going to my password

5
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:28,850
and outputting the current value directly below the password simply so that we can see it on the same

6
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,800
page as the input field.

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:36,400
So if I saved this if I now enter a password here we can see it updated with each keystroke.

8
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,560
That is the default.

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:44,360
It reacts to the input event which means it updates whenever the input here changes.

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:51,150
Now maybe we only want to update it after we enter default password and well clicked in the number inputs.

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:57,500
Basically once we're done finishing this input we can do this by adding a modifier to the model here.

12
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:03,470
I can add the lazy modifier with lazy what this will do is that behind the scenes that will now not

13
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,130
listen to the input event.

14
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,810
So whenever we type something whenever we enter something new but to the change we went which is only

15
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:17,340
fired once we click somewhere else once we leave that input you can see it in action here.

16
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:23,990
If I now remove this you'll see task is still there only once a click into another input field does

17
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,350
tasks disappear.

18
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:31,310
And on the same hand if y now type here it will only appear if I leave that input that might be the

19
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,760
behavior what you want if you don't want to update on each keystroke.

20
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:41,300
For example if you know you're going to rise your values only upon hitting submit anyways or that is

21
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,490
the place where you then want to validate them and use them.

22
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,230
Well you might use lazy to not update this instantly.

23
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:55,250
On the other hand if you want to provide real time validation or give the user some hints and or a completion

24
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,990
you might need that behavior of automatically detecting each keystroke.

25
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:06,110
And not only react once the user is done but it's great to know that you get this option as remote as

26
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,960
you can use our trim to trim any excess whitespace at the beginning and end.

27
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,720
If you want to force that you don't have such whitespace or a number.

28
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:22,310
So DOT number but trim would have been the alternative for trimming that number to four is that behind

29
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,900
the scenes the input is converted to a number right away but they will be a string.

30
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,680
Everything you input here is a string that is how age chemo works.

31
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,710
But if you know you want to work with number in your view code you could add that number as a modifier

32
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,950
like we talked last year so that number like that and that would force it to be transformed to a number

33
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,280
automatically so that you can work with that.

34
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,570
That is how you can use modifiers to add just the input way.

35
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:56,170
So when you react as well as format with trim and number in the way you need it to behave.

1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,830
Great so we had a look at the basic input fields up there.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,200
We learned about modifiers and learned how to set up a text area so multiline strings.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,350
Now it's time to come to more complicated inputs though it's not that difficult to be honest but I want

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:23,370
to have these checkboxes here hooked up so that we can see if these are checked with true or false and

5
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,580
then thereafter we'll have a look at radio buttons and a dropdown here.

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,680
Well let's start with the checkboxes for just over in the code.

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:37,570
We see that here is the code responsible for the checkboxes.

8
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,460
I do have to check boxes which are inputs here nested inside of a label.

9
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:48,300
That is how we set up in Bootstrap and these C S S framework I'm using here and there we basically then

10
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,140
have them well to look like they look here.

11
00:00:52,140 --> 00:01:01,050
The important thing now is we want to bind these inputs here to a specific model to a specific property

12
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,120
Dupee very precise.

13
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,030
What I want to achieve here is we're in the area of selecting which kind of males we want to receive

14
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,070
and this right.

15
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,640
We can check the mail and the normal mail and then some info mails and I want to add that both into

16
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:23,180
one array because that would make sense to have one propertys storing an array of mails we want to receive.

17
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:29,400
We could store it because while we get our values here so we could simply store these strings in an

18
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,020
array and then once we loop through the array what we can easily see.

19
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:38,780
OK we got decent male value and to get the send information model you value or only one of the two.

20
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,300
So that allows us to see which mails the user wants to receive.

21
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,760
How can we tell you she has to do that for us to add this to an array.

22
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,040
Well first of all I'm going to set up the array on there.

23
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,560
So after the message I'm adding sent mail and this is an empty array by default because we haven't checked

24
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,690
anything.

25
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:03,790
And then I can go up to my check boxes and now again add the model and the important thing is to add

26
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,900
it to the input.

27
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:12,310
So not to the surrounding label not to the surrounding div to the individual input demat allow one blind

28
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:20,370
to is of course send mail soda's property property I just created down there desire and the same is

29
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,550
true for the input.

30
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,530
I use the very same model here.

31
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:31,800
So I'm binding to inputs to the same model and what the future will do for me is it will detect this

32
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,400
it will detect that.

33
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:39,990
Well we got a say in the same model year that we got to check boxes here and will automatically merge

34
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:49,530
devalues all these checkboxes into these single aere we set up there so we can see this if Why scroll

35
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,040
down and hear where I output send mail.

36
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,760
I want to output all the elements in the array.

37
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:02,340
I already prepared a list item here where I can simply loop through all my items in the sendmail array.

38
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:10,170
So your item in sendmail and sendmail of course refers to this array the array again which I'm binding

39
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:17,410
up here on my checkboxes and with that I can simply loop through that and then here output the item

40
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,660
to output all the strings saved in the array so all the checkboxes checked.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,970
Well let's see if that works as you want it to work.

42
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,990
Now if can get it on one page and if I hit send mail you see it's edit down there to the list.

43
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:35,970
If I had sent it for mail that is also added and if I remove sent mail we only have send in voicemail.

44
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:42,880
So this is how we can add the values of checkboxes to an array and we can again tell you chess you use

45
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,130
the same array.

46
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:48,310
What we're simply using the same model here on our check box input fields.

47
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:53,710
If we would have different models different properties we would store it in different properties of

48
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,290
course.

49
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:59,050
But if you want that behavior which is not that untypical if you've got a group of checkboxes.

50
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,080
This is how easy chairs makes it for you to use it like that.

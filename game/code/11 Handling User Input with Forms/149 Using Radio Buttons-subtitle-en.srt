1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:09,160
Well after having a look at checkboxes Let's move on to well kind of their sibling radio buttons the

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,200
difference of course is that we may only select one radio button and a group of radio buttons.

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,530
So right now it's not working correctly.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,690
So we want to ensure that we can only select one and then that we store the value off the select radio

5
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,560
button in some property.

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,940
Let's use VHS has to help us there.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:33,610
Well restoring the general there so let's go down to our data field here and simply add gender here

8
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,590
and I'll set it to mail by default since well I am male of course.

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,840
Choose your favorite gender.

10
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,780
Nowadays you get a lot of options here.

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:47,570
So with the generous set year we want to go to the radio about this year and now the important thing

12
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,890
is how do we bind them again.

13
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,680
I set them up in a bootstrap style wrapped by a label to have the styling they do have.

14
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,960
But the modeless of course also added to the input again.

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:06,080
So we always added to the input here not to the wrapping label not to the rep and give to the input.

16
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,740
And here I want to bind to gender just like that.

17
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:17,800
Now I can copy this same code to my radio button doing this actually use a lot of things in the background

18
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,540
first.

19
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,490
You just now know as both radio buttons belong to the same group.

20
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:28,810
So if we saved as we can already see that I could only select one of the two.

21
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:33,550
Now because again Mujeres recognizes they're bound to the same model.

22
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,000
So they are a group so only one of them is selectable.

23
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,600
That's the first important thing.

24
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:46,120
The second important thing is that UJA as automatically stores the value of the selected radio button

25
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,020
devalues.

26
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:52,300
We set up here of course with the normal value attribute in our gender properties.

27
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:59,350
And I can show this by simply outputting gender here like that if I do it like this we can see that

28
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,630
male is selected now.

29
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:07,470
And now watch the area down there it switches to female and back back to male female back to male.

30
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,810
So this is how easy it is to bind radio buttons and of course you could bind more than two.

31
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:19,600
The key thing here is to use the same model which are binding and your chest will handle the rest like

32
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,600
grouping assigning the value correctly.

33
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,670
That is how we use radio buttons and their futures form and how we can use the property as we switch

34
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,750
between the buttons.

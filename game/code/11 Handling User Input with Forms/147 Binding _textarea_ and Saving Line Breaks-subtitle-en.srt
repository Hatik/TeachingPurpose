00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,410
Now let's continue with our forum how shall you deal with a text area like this one.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,670
How does this work.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,700
Well let's go back to the forum and here is my text area.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,460
Unsurprisingly it also works with V model.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,480
So life does not already have a node up there though.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,650
Interpellation between the text area or opening a closing tag like interpolating a task variable does

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,870
not work.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,440
Instead you should use the model to set the default value for want to do this.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,000
Well let's bind to message here.

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:40,140
And of course I need to create a new property named message in my data field therefore message.

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,890
Now this could be a long text by default.

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:49,490
I'll simply pick a short one and you will see that this now prae populates this message box here.

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,080
So this is how you pre-populated that that's just important to keep in mind.

14
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,980
You use the model like with average input fields.

15
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,680
But if you want to set a default value year don't do it between the opening and closing tag of the text

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,110
area.

17
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:07,380
Use vi mall for that like you do the input fields but with the text area having the opening and closing

18
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:15,210
tag you could think that you can access this between area here and use string interpolation there and

19
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,810
that will actually not work as intended.

20
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,790
So make sure to not use this area and use the model instead.

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:29,870
So let me look at my data field Oh and that should be of course the password of my user data.

22
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:37,850
And then your message shell of course output My message that we see how easy it is to to see and you

23
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,030
text here.

24
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:48,140
And if I change that to change text something else well then we see whoops that it also updates sound

25
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,820
there.

26
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:53,650
Now what you also see is that it doesn't keep the line break though.

27
00:01:53,860 --> 00:02:00,070
What if you want to keep that structure what you wanted to keep that line break and not can word it

28
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,540
to a single line string like it does right now.

29
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,000
Well actually it does sort of multi-line.

30
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:11,620
I'm just not outputting it like this but outputting it with multiple lines is as easy as adding a new

31
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,570
style to my paragraph down there and that's normal style knobbing view Che aspecific.

32
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:23,470
And here you want to set whitespace to prie that's a C S S option which will keep your multi-line string

33
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:30,850
so as you can now see I am keeping the line breaks now what so it was a pure output styling thing not

34
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,570
something you messed up.

35
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,740
It is stored as a multi-line string that's important to understand and keep in mind if you wanted and

36
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:43,660
sent it to a server let's say and save it there you can contain the styling or the formatting you have

37
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,470
set up here.

38
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:50,010
And with that I basically mean adding line breaks and this de-evolved input field or default text area

39
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:50,460
here.

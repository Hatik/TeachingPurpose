1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:08,270
Until now we're loading the different users here year our header by having two different lanes where

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,830
a hard code the user ID that's not very realistic.

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,990
It would be more realistic to have like a list of users we can choose from and click them.

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,570
And I also get these extra components we haven't used yet.

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,670
Turns out end users start component.

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,410
I do have such a list.

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,530
So now time to change this and use this list instead.

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:36,130
So I will remove the second link in my head a year and go back to just slash user here.

9
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:43,040
If I click on user and forgetable also adjust my user route to just be slash user here or just use that

10
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:51,590
as apothegm And so that my usual component now gets loaded I also will remove all that can't and except

11
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,370
for the Navigate to home button.

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,730
But no worries will soon start working with parameterless again.

13
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,910
I just want this to work fine again like this.

14
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:07,730
And now I want to implement some child routes some nested drought's because all the other user components

15
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,380
start editing in detail Shippy nested inside the usual component.

16
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,020
They all belong to the user feature.

17
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,820
So they certainly should not be nested inside the home component or anything like that.

18
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:25,520
Instead I now want to have some routes in my user component so that we can load different components

19
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:33,350
inside their well to do this I need to configure my supper cards here and I can do this by adding a

20
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,280
new property to the route which should have some nested routes.

21
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,750
It's called Children and this is again an area of routes which will now be nested after or inside of

22
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,740
this route route.

23
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:52,070
So inside slash user they are four in there we again specify a couple of javascript objects where each

24
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,290
has a POV.

25
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,840
And the important thing is if you now have a path which starts with a slash.

26
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:05,840
This will again be appended directly after your domain so example dot com slash whatever you type here.

27
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,530
If you leave a way to slash though it will be appended to dispatch.

28
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,660
So the path of your parent route so choose whatever you want.

29
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:20,090
You can technically nest them with deep pockets starting after your domain.

30
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:26,640
Or you can ask them technically and logically by also having your POV reflect the nesting.

31
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,030
But you don't need to do that maybe you have a use case where they should be nested technically in the

32
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:36,820
component and the user component but that shouldn't be reflected in the path here.

33
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,690
I would choose the approach where I will append them to slash user.

34
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,420
So here I want to load an empty path actually.

35
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:52,210
So just slash the user to load my user start component which of course I need to import.

36
00:02:52,340 --> 00:03:00,010
So that will be user start and I can already import user detail.

37
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:00,980
Whoops.

38
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:08,310
User detail and user added just like that user added.

39
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:15,240
And then you're a news user start but then it will have two routes the first one share load a specific

40
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:22,000
ID and the second one also uses the ID but then loads the added page.

41
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:27,820
I'm not nesting does in user detail component here because I don't want to load it on the same page

42
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,740
as user detail.

43
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:35,420
So here I now have my three subcomponents to my user component.

44
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:40,720
Now of course we also need a place to load them because they won't be loaded in our router view here

45
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,760
in the airport view file because that is our routes router.

46
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,590
But now we got nested routes.

47
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,400
So we have to set up a new router.

48
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,670
You are a user of your file.

49
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:57,440
So here I will simply add a your horizontal line to differentiate that and that have router view there.

50
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:05,610
And now this will allow me to load this router view or to load the sub routes we can already see this

51
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:11,680
if I reload as we see the user start component is selected by default because I set it up to have an

52
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,520
empty path after a slash user which is where I'm at right now and if I were to enter one year we see

53
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,790
the user details page.

54
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:27,180
Of course the one that's not extracted right now but we see this works so that we now improve this.

55
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:35,560
Now I want to make DS list items here clickable to actually load and never nested component namely the

56
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,250
detailed component let's say.

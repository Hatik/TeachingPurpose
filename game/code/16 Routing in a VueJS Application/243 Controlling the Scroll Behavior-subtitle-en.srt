1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:06,760
Configuring the scrolling behavior in a view chair as we're in the app using the view router is really

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,840
simple.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:14,900
We go to the main chairs follow we set up the router and then we can pass a number property the scroll

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,340
behavior property that actually is a method to be precise.

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,450
And you we can configure how we want it to behave.

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,970
This method has free arguments.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:30,370
Two from enties save position in case we were using the back button and the user scroll down a bit.

8
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:35,220
The browser automatically saves to position and we can use that position here too.

9
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:44,200
Now this function expects to get back ever an object where we have the x and y coordinate where we didn't

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:53,670
specify where to go for example x 0 and Y is zero or as or so the tag we had before.

11
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:59,380
So this idea of some element let's try with this x and y is set to zero.

12
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:05,920
So dabblings crawled top that scroll down a bit by setting us to seven hundred seven hundred let's say

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,560
the y coordinate.

14
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:08,830
Now if I go to home.

15
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:13,900
Well we don't really see it there because these pages aren't long enough.

16
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:19,360
But if I click on a user and edit user you'll see we're now scroll down and that's not because of this

17
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,020
hash tag data thing.

18
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:26,230
This just happened because we use the View chance Roger and efferent only works if we don't load the

19
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,490
page by entering the euro.

20
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,130
But all three are in the application.

21
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,660
We're still getting pushdown.

22
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:37,540
So this is because we set the scroll position to be this far down.

23
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,900
Now the alternative is to use a select or.

24
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,230
So if we have one.

25
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,740
So first I'd check if the route I to navigate to.

26
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:52,360
If this has these hash property being set so if this is not MTSO if it does exist in which case I want

27
00:01:52,360 --> 00:02:00,580
to return an object whereas say select or and now I use this hash which is a string if it exists this

28
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,240
string we set up here.

29
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,800
Excuse me here.

30
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,570
This string will be solved.

31
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,540
This will give me this place to navigate to but only if we do have it.

32
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,760
Otherwise I will scroll scroll down.

33
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,280
So if I save this now and head over to the application click Edit user.

34
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:26,530
We're still going down but this time due to this hash value being set which I can easily demonstrate

35
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:31,660
by commenting out the average part navigating back and reloading does clicking edit user again we're

36
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,990
still down there even though I commented out this other part.

37
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,180
So that's how we can use d or how we can set the scrolling behavior and how we can use our hash values

38
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,760
if we do have any.

39
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:49,360
Finally some step you might want to include is you want to check if safe position is set because if

40
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,940
the user navigated back with the back button it's probably not the desired behavior to scroll him all

41
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:00,100
the way down app or whatever you maybe just want to scroll him to the position he was at.

42
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,020
So you can simply return to a safe position.

43
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:07,900
In this case and only if this is not said do we check if the hash is set and only if does not set then

44
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,550
we maybe scroll him up all the way to the top of the page.

45
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:19,230
And with that we should have a fine navigation or a fine scroll behavior control in place.

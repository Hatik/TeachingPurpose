1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:06,120
Well in this module we really learn a lot about writing.

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,350
We really took a deep dive into the view chess router.

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:17,080
We learn so much about setting up routes navigating passing parameters reacting to parameter changes

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:24,070
passing query parameters scrolling loading components lazy loading protecting guards with guards protecting

5
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,440
routes with guards and so much more.

6
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:33,550
I think you're well-prepared to now use this router in your application and build a real big single

7
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,140
page application with it.

8
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:42,460
Actually we will soon build a bigger single page application in this course right after the next module

9
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:47,390
and I can only encourage you as always to play around with that and practice it.

10
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:54,070
Set your own challenges create your own little test applications and navigate around like crazy to really

11
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:59,150
understand how this all works and which features it has and how you may use them.

12
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,440
See you in the next module.

1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:07,590
So far we learned how to navigate how to use name drought's and how to pass parameters how to have nested

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:14,160
routes but sometimes you also have some query parameters query parameters are the parameters you have

3
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:19,670
the end of your you are always at the end separated with a question mark and then something like equals

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,830
100 B equals hello or something like this.

5
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:30,120
This would be a query parameter and this is mostly optional data you pass with or out for example a

6
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,300
stored retry redirection route.

7
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:37,650
If you redirect the user to log in first and then want to redirect him to his or a traditional route

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,330
or something like this to pass such query parameters.

9
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:48,030
You can either go to your route to where you set up the path directly and at questionmark.

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,750
E Akos 100 for example.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,460
Or if you use the object syntax like we do here in user detail you can add a number property Judah's

12
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,490
object which is called query.

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,200
This again takes an object as a value.

14
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,600
And here you set up key value pairs where you set up your query parameters with because a query parameter

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,470
always is a key like a.

16
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,310
And then the value like 100.

17
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,070
And this is exactly what you set up in this object.

18
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:29,640
So let's do this let's say low cal should be a string N and then let's all the set Q equal to 100 to

19
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,290
a number.

20
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:37,350
So this shall has these two things as query parameters to the user DTL route or to the user added route

21
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,240
excuse me.

22
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:44,650
And if an hour choose a user and click Edit user you now see we have a local equal and and q equals

23
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,470
100.

24
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,890
So these are to query parameters I set up here.

25
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,690
So this extra data now to extract as extra data.

26
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,420
Let's do it on the added user template here.

27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,840
Here again I will not set it up in the reactive way with a white shirt because I know this will always

28
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,280
be recreated but could of course do this.

29
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:09,180
But here we want to output a locale which I can again access on my loaded route.

30
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,280
And then its not parents but instead its query.

31
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:21,570
And then I know I stored it in a key named local and for the analytics parameter and thats lets name

32
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,690
it which was Q..

33
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,740
I simply access Q here.

34
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,390
Well and with that to place you already see it reloaded here.

35
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,480
And if what change my query parameter here to 105 we see that reflected here too because the page were

36
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,170
loaded.

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,650
If you do have links which allow you to reload the page without destroying this component forest you

38
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,420
want to set up a watch to dynamically update us as learned to have normal parameters.

39
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:51,850
And all of this you're also able to send query parameters and to use them and not just normal parameters.

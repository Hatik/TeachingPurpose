1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,860
So when stalled out from the last video.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:09,680
Now let's add it to our application and then set up some roads we do edit in this main.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:16,870
File the exact same place where we add a view resource before and we do add it in the same way we imported

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,810
the router for example his name is up to you from view router like this.

5
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:29,380
And with that added here or with this import I now again use you use your to add the new plug into view

6
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,140
and you're right at the viewer router that's all.

7
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,650
With that routing is enabled the router is added to the application.

8
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,800
The next thing is we should set up some routes so that we can see this.

9
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:46,840
Now you could set them up in a separate file and then import this file into the main Chia's file.

10
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,340
You definitely want to register them here though on your route.

11
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:56,740
Instance especially when creating single page applications you will only have one route instance this

12
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:02,230
one year and thereafter it's only about switching out components which are kind of their own instances

13
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,050
but you will have only one instance created with the new keyword.

14
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:11,170
So definitely register you are out in this rude instance otherwise you will not get the desired behavior

15
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,970
and some problems and errors.

16
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,830
And then again you can sit up here in this file or outsource it.

17
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,000
Now I will outsource sends in a real application you might have a couple of different routes and this

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,880
could quickly blow this file here.

19
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,030
So I would set up a router start J file.

20
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:33,550
Now India's routes chess file and want to export a constant named route's which should hold Mirallas

21
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,150
holding route's means it has an error rate.

22
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:41,200
And in this interview we got a couple of different objects where each object will read Precentor route

23
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,900
as soon as we register it of course.

24
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,700
Right now it's only a normal aere.

25
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,250
So let's create the first route this first object.

26
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,710
Each route needs a path.

27
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,980
This is what will be appended into your L to your domains.

28
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:01,370
So after your domain so if your domain is example dot com Whoops you get the point of it is example

29
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:08,860
dot com and here you have a POV of let's say user then this would trigger whenever we visit exampled

30
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,590
or com user.

31
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:16,510
This is how we set this up so we set up the path through slash and then well the name of the segment

32
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,570
or whatever we wanted to be displayed in the URL.

33
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,980
So this is our path.

34
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:26,140
And then the next step is to set up the component we want to load when we visit this path.

35
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:33,460
Now since I was a user here I want to display the usual component so imported here give it a name of

36
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:41,600
use or maybe from dot slash component's slash user user dot you in this case your.

37
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,700
So I import this file and then I simply add it like this.

38
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:52,560
This now will tell you chaps Whenever we visit our domain slash user load this component.

39
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:59,950
Now having only one lbf is boring so let's add a second one and let's add the home component here to

40
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,460
it.

41
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,040
So this component like Truth or Dare.

42
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,950
That of course lives in the components folder not in the user subfolder.

43
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:13,100
And here I want to visit this let's say if the path is actually empty.

44
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,570
So this shall be our route of route.

45
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,330
What gets loaded first.

46
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,350
This can be done by setting it up like this.

47
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:25,550
So whenever we have just our Dumaine slash nothing I want to load the home component here.

48
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,900
So these are the two routes I set up here.

49
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,380
Now having the routes and this file doesn't do that much this fall it's not even getting used anywhere.

50
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,380
So let's go back to the main or Chia's file because I said we should register our routes here.

51
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,520
So here is a good place to import our routes.

52
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:50,980
So here I shall import from my route start J.S. file and since I named the constant there I have to

53
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,260
use the syntax what to call the braces.

54
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,260
And I can import the routes again as Tikhon's and I'm exporting here.

55
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:06,700
So with that imported here I can now after using my routers after registering this plug in I can now

56
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:15,480
add something I can create a new router all the stored near constant and I'll name it new view router

57
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,550
using this package I import here in this router.

58
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:23,750
I have to pass an object where I set up my router.

59
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:31,350
So here I set it up by passing routes which I import here now Yewtree is six.

60
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:37,380
If I just pass this to this object this will automatically create this mapping to it so it will have

61
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,670
a cure for all its valuable and routes be routes to.

62
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,500
I can do it as if I use the same name for key and value.

63
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,150
So this is just a shortcut.

64
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,300
This will now pass my routes to the view router and the final step is to go to my view instance here

65
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,250
and add the router to it.

66
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,210
And again I use the same shortcut where key and value is the same.

67
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:03,390
This would be the long Worthen I can just pass router with dad my routes are it just Surt.

68
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,800
Now we all need a place to render them.

69
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,410
So we need a place our HMO code where you check should actually load that component.

70
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:16,770
So either the home or the user or component because thankfully it will it will not replace our whole

71
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,750
page with this component.

72
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,310
Thankfully it will not do that.

73
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,680
So we have to tell it where to load it then.

74
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:29,250
So back in Aptor you fall which holds my main template are at a horizontal line and then we simply mark

75
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:35,550
the place where the component of the currently active roud should be loaded with router view with this

76
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,680
component.

77
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:43,050
Thats a built in component shipping with the router and it tells the router please load to component

78
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,710
which has to be loaded in this place.

79
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:52,680
Well and with dad if we now navigate back and reload we automatically see the home page because that

80
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,820
is our route route.

81
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,900
Keep that in mind.

82
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,340
We set up an empty path for Dad.

83
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:03,560
You also see our view or I'll get a chest that now has this hash tag that's the default mode d your

84
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,090
router works with this hash mode.

85
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,750
I'll come back to the available notes and how they work in one of the next videos.

86
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,550
For now let's ignore it.

87
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,220
We cannot simply add user at the end of this route to go to our user page just like that.

88
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,710
And this already is our router in place.

89
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,860
We were able to navigate to load our routes.

90
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,320
We set up our routes.

91
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:30,180
Now of course it would be nice to have some links in our page so that we can actually collect somewhere

92
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,590
to navigate instead of having to hard code in your l.

93
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:38,830
And well we'll also have a look at this you are ill and see what this is all about with this hashtag.

94
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,510
Actually I'll do this right in the next video.

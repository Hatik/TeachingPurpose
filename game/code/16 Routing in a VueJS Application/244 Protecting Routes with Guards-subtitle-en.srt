1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:10,850
Now speaking of navigation controls we're already deeply in the routeing topic and there's one thing

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,570
which you will need from time to time.

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:19,970
You want to control if a user is allowed to enter a certain route or if he's allowed to leave it.

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:28,010
Let's say if we load the user detail page here and then we click on edit we want to control whether

5
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,440
the user was allowed to visit the page.

6
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,890
Let's say with arbitrary user is locked in check.

7
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:39,960
And then if the user was an user at a page we want to control if he's allowed to leave by let's say

8
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:47,810
in a flowing in a button in here where our eyes simply want to say confirm So let's say some edits were

9
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:54,560
made and only after this button was clicked do we want to let the user navigate away our wise if changes

10
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,310
were confirmed.

11
00:00:55,310 --> 00:01:00,120
For example we want to at least ask the user if he wants to navigate away.

12
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:06,310
So we get these two checks before a user enters or out and after he will read once he wants to leave

13
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:06,860
out.

14
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,540
Let him put it like this.

15
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,940
Let's have a look at these two cases and the next video is.

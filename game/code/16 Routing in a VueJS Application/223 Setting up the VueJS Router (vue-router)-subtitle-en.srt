1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:06,730
The cool thing about this routeing section is all the things you learn before it will work just like

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:12,470
you learned it but now you are able to simply switch out different components in your application through

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,900
the router and therefore load different pieces dynamically.

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,810
So where do we start.

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:26,290
I do have a nice application here as you already know it mostly with bootstrap aborted in this age time

6
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:32,560
of fall and then in this after you fall just a relatively empty template but you see already also created

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,360
some components which will use you'll find to start a project attached to this lecture.

8
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:44,260
I did create a couple of components which are pretty much empty and only display what they contain basically

9
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,130
so that we are able to select the user and so on.

10
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,780
I created these components because for routeing it's all about dynamically switching these components.

11
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:57,150
These components can kind of represent our pages if you want to look at it like this.

12
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:02,390
And therefore it's key to have multiple of them so that we can demonstrate this.

13
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,740
Well let's start simple.

14
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:12,180
And let's actually begin with setting up our application here and at some routes to it.

15
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:19,180
For that we need the view router like in the last lecture or the last module excuse me where we use

16
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,730
the view resource package.

17
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:27,460
Now I'm going to install a third party package the router because it's not included in VHS by default

18
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:34,330
because veejays in its core maybe use like we used to before to only dump in certain widgets or pieces

19
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,930
into existing applications into multi-page applications.

20
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,830
But with this package we can now enable single page features.

21
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:51,220
So your NPM and then install mine's mine is saved to save as a production dependency view rowdier now

22
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,530
by hitting enter.

23
00:01:52,570 --> 00:02:00,430
This will pull down the router install it and is finished and it automatically installs the 2.0 version

24
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:05,710
all throughout which is the one for the chest 2.0 which we are of course using in this course.

25
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,920
So the router was installed here.

26
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,320
And with that router installed it's time to set up some routes in the next video.

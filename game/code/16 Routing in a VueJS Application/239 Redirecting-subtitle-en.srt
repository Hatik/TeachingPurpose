1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:05,090
So we've played around with routeing quite a bit here now.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,400
One case we haven't covered is the following.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:13,090
What if the user enters anything here which is not covered by the app.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,510
While we don't see an error here but we also don't see a fitting page.

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:23,140
So we want to redirect in some cases especially in cases like this where any route not covered by our

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,570
router is entered.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:31,790
Well the two things work together well here but you can of course also redirect on any specific path.

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,450
So let me first Chodas I'll add a new route here.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,060
At the end so that my more specific POVs come first.

10
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:44,090
And here are set up a path of redirect me like this.

11
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,490
And I want to set up a redirection so I'm not going to load a component here.

12
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,290
Instead what I will do here is I'll add the redirect key.

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,780
This allows me to specify a path to which I should redirect the user.

14
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:02,800
So here let's say you want to redirect to just user so I specify the path as a string here.

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,010
And with that we should have an application where if a wizard slash redirect me I should add a slash

16
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:09,930
there for here.

17
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:15,930
If a wizard slash redirect me were redirected to slash user as a let's try this out.

18
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,340
Let's go to slash redirect me and we're back to slash user.

19
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,120
This is how we can redirect.

20
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:30,850
You can also specify an object here to again use a name drought's for example to go to user edit for

21
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:36,500
example and then pass some parameter parameters or you go to home for example like this.

22
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,270
So you can specify a normal object.

23
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:47,380
You also used in your router link or here for pushing when navigating in code this is the normal object

24
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:52,540
for setting up a route you want to navigate to and you can use that for redirecting to.

25
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:59,290
So does this how we can redirect the user and make sure we're navigating him where we want him to be

26
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:04,940
navigated but we're not capturing the case that I enter anything in here.

27
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:10,680
Now in order to be able to handle such Trout's will have a different set up in the next video.

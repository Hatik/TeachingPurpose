1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:08,030
So far we learn a lot about routing but all our routes were fairly static.

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,150
We didn't have any dynamic pieces in these routes.

3
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:18,630
If we have a look at this especially for the user it would make sense that we want to pass an idea in

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,330
the Ural in our path here.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,390
So the wizard.

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:28,160
Let's say users last 10 and then we load this or we are able to use this idea on the component which

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,200
gets loaded.

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:37,220
Well let's have a look at passing such IDs in this module or in this video to pass any dynamic piece

9
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,680
or segment in your path.

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,840
You simply add it.

11
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:46,220
But then if a colon in front of it and then a name of your choice for example I.D. It will be this name

12
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,040
by which you able to later retrieve it.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:55,070
This will now tell the router that the user component chip is loaded whenever you visit users flash

14
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:00,060
something whereas something will be interpreted as the ID.

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:06,150
You can also make this more complex so will come back to us by adding for example flash details thereafter.

16
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,470
It's simply a flexible element you embed in your you are l.

17
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:18,320
Now with that added I'll go to my header and right now user doesn't really pass this idea here though.

18
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,520
All simulated by hard coding.

19
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:29,810
Ten in here will change this in the future if I do it like this and I now reload the page and click

20
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,510
on user you see the Eurail now it's user 10.

21
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,430
And we still go to user page because it does match this path.

22
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:41,810
If I remove 10 year it doesn't work because that doesn't work anymore that doesn't exist anymore.

23
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,860
Our path leading to user component is user.

24
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:52,400
And then something dynamic like the 10 here now that we're passing this now since it is dynamic it would

25
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,700
also make sense that we're able to retrieve it dynamically.

26
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,250
So let's have a look at this now.

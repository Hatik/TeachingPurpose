1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,980
It would all be nice if we could style the link.

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,760
If it is active.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:13,630
The nice thing is that bootstrap and theory gives us this class we can attach to the list item called

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,720
active.

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,640
And if we do attach it well this is marked as active.

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:27,130
The problem we have though is well we have this router link act of class at a two hour anchored tag

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,030
and not to the parent element here.

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,670
So these are two problems at once.

9
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:32,620
The name is wrong.

10
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:36,580
It's link active instead of just active and it's under wrong element.

11
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:44,470
Well how can we solve that we can achieve this by removing our list items here and only using ral drilling

12
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,770
and then overwriting.

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:53,590
What does rattlings shell be like or shell be you so we can add the tech property to route link and

14
00:00:53,590 --> 00:01:00,220
set this to apply to trade a list item instead of an anchor tag and then we simply nest the anchor tag

15
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:05,990
inside of it with no attributes at all just an empty anchored tag like this.

16
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:10,080
And what this will do is router link will now set up the link on the list item.

17
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:15,550
It may have element inside of it that's no problem rogering link may take any content you want to set

18
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,480
up as a link.

19
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:22,780
But now the real link is still a list item element which we set up here and now we can all to override

20
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:28,250
declasse if you want to use by setting the active class attribute here as well.

21
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,960
And I can set this to active.

22
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,440
This will make sure that now instead of router link active it will attach the act of class to the active

23
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,230
link.

24
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,780
So let me add this to the second groundling here too.

25
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,560
And with dead we can always see that it works.

26
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:49,960
Though we also see an issue it correctly selects user but homestays selected at all times.

27
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,390
Now this happens because the default behavior for the active class or for determining whether a link

28
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:59,750
is active or not is that it looks at where this link leads to.

29
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:07,440
So just slash and then it looks at your URL your L and by default it marks links active What ever you

30
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:12,690
or you or else starts with D link or with D2 lbf here.

31
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,530
Now clearly all our your ads start with Slash after the domain.

32
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,180
All our payoffs start with Slash.

33
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,570
Now that's a great behavior if you have nested routes like a user and then ID and you always want to

34
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,050
keep the user select in your nav bar.

35
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,600
It's not the desired behavior though.

36
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:37,030
In a case like days when we don't want to mark the route route as active all the time so we can add

37
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,910
a number reconfiguration configuration attribute here which is called exact and by adding it like this

38
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,740
we override the defaults.

39
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:52,020
Now this has to be an exact match so it doesn't suffice that our POF starts with Tea Party or indeed

40
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,710
to link or in this Poth year.

41
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,140
Instead it has to be the full path with match which matches this.

42
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:05,480
So now you see it only matches if we are on home and not if we are on user.

43
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,640
So if Dad was dialing the active link on our items on the list item here instead of D-Link and we also

44
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,830
override the act of class and make sure it only gets attached when we want to attach it.

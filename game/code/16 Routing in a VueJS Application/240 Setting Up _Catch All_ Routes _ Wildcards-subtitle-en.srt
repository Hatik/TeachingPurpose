1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:07,600
So we want to be able to handle any route the user may enter which doesn't exist in our application.

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,670
We can easily do this by adding a new route as the last road here which should catch everything which

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,830
is not handled by any of our other routes.

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,980
And here are set up the path to be star like this.

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,090
What this will do is that.

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:31,120
Now if I redirect in such a case to just slash I can enter whatever I want here and I'm redirected to

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,500
the home page because Starratt catches it all.

8
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,670
If I enter something slash something that also works.

9
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:46,470
So Star is now the wildcard character which catches all over routes which are not handled first here.

10
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:53,040
So user still works and so on but everything which is not handled in my other routes is now catched

11
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,490
by the star route which in this case leads to a redirect to my home page.

12
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,730
So this is how you can set up a generic catch all roud with this star wildcard character.

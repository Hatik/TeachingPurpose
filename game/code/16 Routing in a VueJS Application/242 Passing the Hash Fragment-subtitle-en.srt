1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,680
So noted we're able to animate this.

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:09,060
Let me also have a look at something else which we haven't covered yet.

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:16,660
Sometimes you want to navigate to a specific part on the page you're navigating to marked with a hash

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:22,480
tag at the end and then the anchor name of some element in your age HTML code which has this anchor

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,940
as an ID.

6
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:30,710
Let me simulate this for example on the user added page here.

7
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:41,080
Let's say we do have a div in there and this div does have a height of 700 pixels so that it needs sort.

8
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,940
And it makes sure that we need to scroll.

9
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:51,130
So we do have does height of this day of and below this if we get some extra data in a paragraph and

10
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,690
this paragraph has an ID of data let's say.

11
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:01,690
Now if I go to the edit page I'm on it right now you see here's data at the bottom.

12
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:08,230
If I now enter a hash tag data the browser will automatically come down their default browser behavior.

13
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:15,400
Now if we navigate in our application we first also might want to be able to pass this extra data hash

14
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,520
fragment here.

15
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,590
And second we want to simulate this behavior of jumping down there.

16
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:26,330
Or maybe generally we want to control where the page scrolls to when we navigate.

17
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:33,130
So we can do this by first having a look at how we can pass this hash segment.

18
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:39,050
So let's say when we click on user detail here what we already passed equerry poems.

19
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,620
We're now passing a third parameter here.

20
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,780
And this third parameter is now the fragment we want to use.

21
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:55,060
Now since this is getting Rob Long here I will quickly set up a script here and export my javascript

22
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:01,090
object and store it in a separate property year in my variable and my data object.

23
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,900
So here this shall be my link.

24
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,680
Let's say.

25
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:12,130
And now here to simply is this javascript object from up here so I can simply grab the whole object

26
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,450
and enter it here.

27
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:22,450
But now I'll simply restructure it is to make it look nicer here so that it's easier to see or to understand

28
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,200
what we're all passing with this object.

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,120
So I'd say that looks much better and then I can simply pass the link here.

30
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:35,130
It is a dynamic binding in the end so I can pass my property which represents this object.

31
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,160
And for this to work I need to make sure that here I hate this route because I'm now inside this new

32
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,350
instance.

33
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,160
And with that I can all to pass my hash fragment.

34
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,450
Now it is simply a string.

35
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,460
For example hash tag data.

36
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:53,620
What this will do is that once I go back to my application to the user page here and I select the user

37
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,790
and click Edit user we see hash tag data appended to the end.

38
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,890
But what you also notice is it doesn't scroll down there.

39
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:07,390
But if I were to load this in a browser and come from a number of pages I should say so if I first go

40
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,590
to home and now introduce you see it does jump to the end.

41
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,450
Now I want the same behavior with the U.K.'s because right now it doesn't.

42
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,850
So you see how we can pass a hash fragment.

43
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:24,190
But now in the next video we want to have a look at how we can control the scrolling behavior when we

44
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,010
do navigate to a number page.

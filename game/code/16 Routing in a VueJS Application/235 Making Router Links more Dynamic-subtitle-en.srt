1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:07,000
So we're able to choose a user a year and Lotus in its own component.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,960
Now let's fine tuned it and add edit button here on the user details so that we load the user edit component

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,210
in such a case.

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:25,120
So your eyes simply want to set up a router link which shell use a button as the tag team tag and it

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,880
should navigate you to what.

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,310
Let's look at our routes.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,820
I want to go to this route.

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:36,250
So I need slash user slash the currently loaded ID slash at it.

9
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,350
Well that's shouldn't be too hard.

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:47,850
I can simply say user and then a year I somehow need to pass the id to do so I will bind to dynamically

11
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,720
by adding a colon or the bind for the long form.

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,560
And this allows me now to pass our things than just a simple string.

13
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,360
So here I will actually pass a string plus.

14
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:11,040
And now roud Perens ID plus slash edit and I will show you an alternative to constructing your POV like

15
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,850
this manually in one of the next videos.

16
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:23,190
But for now lets keep it like this and let say added link edit user here and go to my user and click

17
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:23,990
Edit user.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,570
We now see him loading user one added and I'm on the added user page here.

19
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:39,830
Now I can also add my classes here today so lets add class Shelby button button primary to give to a

20
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:45,380
nice hairstyling that of course should work just fine like this.

21
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:54,680
And now again this is how I load my user or how I can pass a parameter dynamically with Colin.

22
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,270
And then constructing the path manually.

23
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,990
But now in the next video I will show you a more elegant way of doing this.

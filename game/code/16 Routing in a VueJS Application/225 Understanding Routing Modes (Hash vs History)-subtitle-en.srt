1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:05,430
So we were able to set up our routes navigate their last video.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:11,470
What we also saw is that we have this hashtag of your L which was added automatically by The View rowdier.

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,140
Now it was edit because it's a default set up the router uses.

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:20,970
It's a style you see a lot and single page applications due to a specific reason.

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,080
If you have a normal route normal you are all I should say without the hash tag.

6
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,810
Then each request once you hit enter on your keyboard gets sent to the server.

7
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,810
This is how the browser and how the web works and which makes sense would be hard to visit web site

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,120
web pages if it wouldn't get sent to the server.

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,580
The problem with sending it to the server is that we want to handle the route in our single page application

10
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,320
that we don't want to get the route to the server.

11
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:54,030
We want to handle it on our local page here though if we wisit our page for the first time in this case

12
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,620
you want to get it to the server because we need to get a single page.

13
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:03,620
But if for example with a slash user without a hash tag we would like to get our single page the next

14
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:10,550
aged a file and then take over and handle the rest of the well with our single page instead with the

15
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,040
browser or the server.

16
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:18,230
I should say well the hash tag allows us to do just that the part in front of the hash tag is sent to

17
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,910
the server so to say this will give it it give us back our index page to him of the file.

18
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:29,630
And the part after the hash tag is then handed over to our running Javascript application and may be

19
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,490
handled by that application.

20
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:35,200
So that now we can extract our payoffs from there.

21
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:41,960
This works fine and it spares us the issues you might face if we would have to configure our server

22
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,610
in a certain way that it kind of gives us back the right thing though.

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,970
It turns out configuring our our server isn't that difficult and having these you're out.

24
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,240
Isn't that pretty.

25
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:59,360
It would be nicer to have the normal you are where we don't have a hash tag and still be able to use

26
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,700
our single page application as we are used to do.

27
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,040
Well turns out it's not that hard.

28
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:11,360
The thing you will have to do on your server which I can't show you here is that you need to return

29
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,920
the next HVM file.

30
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,090
In all cases.

31
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:19,550
So even in 4 0 4 aero cases because that is what your server will throw with you with this route which

32
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,860
hasn't registered on your server.

33
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,020
This is what your server needs to do.

34
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:31,430
Always return the index HVM file because that in the index each team will file our view Cheras application

35
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:36,250
gets launched and hence is able to then parse out your L and take over.

36
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,530
This is very convenient and gives us nicer routes.

37
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:46,640
Now in order to tell the future has router that you want to use this way of setting up or you or else

38
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:53,370
and that our server is configured correctly is simply to go to our router which we create here.

39
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,920
And not only passed the routes but also demoed property which you may set to history.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,770
That's the name for this.

41
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,230
No hash textile.

42
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,580
It's called history mode.

43
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:08,190
The default mode is hash which you don't have to set because well it's the default.

44
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,520
You can override it with history and this will lead to the falling behavior.

45
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,570
Now hit enter here excuse me reload.

46
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,740
Hit enter.

47
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,280
You now see estilo at the user page.

48
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,040
You'll see it reloads the page but then it navigates correctly.

49
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:28,340
That of course works because our development server we're using here in the web pic project is automatically

50
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,720
set up in a way to give us back to index.

51
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,770
Tim all fall in all circumstances.

52
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,080
Revised as would not work.

53
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:40,530
You'd need to configure your server appropriately and to learn more about that wizard or google for

54
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,720
the router.

55
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:46,650
And then you may wisit the official documentation on it.

56
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,130
They're generally a good place to dive deeper.

57
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:55,070
There you will find th's you will find history more point which explains how you may set up your server

58
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,660
to serve the correct file but that's just a little addition.

59
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,340
Let's now head back in now that we understood how we can change this.

60
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,640
I will keep this history mode here.

61
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,660
Let's now go back to the question how we can add links in our page to actually be able to click there

62
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,650
and navigate around.

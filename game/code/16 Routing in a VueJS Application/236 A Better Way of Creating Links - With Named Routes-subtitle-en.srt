1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:06,490
In a class with you we have to pass a dynamic element and our link.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:12,260
And that led to a POV which had to be a construct like this not to get that convenient especially if

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:19,400
that gets longer thankfully viewed Chasse or the router offers a better possibility or or a better way

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,410
of doing that.

5
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:28,040
We can give our routes names so any routes that js file I can assign a name to just route by simply

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,600
adding name here and all name and user added for example.

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,810
Now choose any name you like.

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,820
This is just one example here.

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,930
So user added this now the name of this route.

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:47,120
And I can now identify this route by name which means that on any page wherever I set up a link for

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,900
example in user detail I can now change this to pass an object instead of a string.

12
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,750
Of course you need to Colan for that.

13
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,030
Otherwise you're not able to pass an object.

14
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,250
And in this object you've got a couple of properties to define which path you want to navigate to.

15
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,330
They could set up payoff here and do the same thing from before.

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,240
Well would not really save you some time but you can add power if you're just that you know that but

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,590
you can also say name and the name was used were added as a string.

18
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:30,650
Now this is the name of course I set up here and now view chess will automatically populate this real

19
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,700
path then with the parfit extract from this name drought.

20
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,530
This is the cool thing we don't have to type the full path.

21
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,700
I can now pass a second argument here which is to name parents.

22
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,900
Does that keep you chairs will recognize.

23
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:50,100
Which again is an object where I can now pass key value pairs of the parameters I want to pass to this

24
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,810
POV.

25
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,090
Because of course this specific part your needs to get that ID.

26
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:03,890
So in my parens optic here is simply say id and this is now route parents Id like is much easier if

27
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,920
I now save this and go to just slash user one.

28
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:13,030
You see if we click Edit user it still goes to User 1 added.

29
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,700
But now we had much less effort in setting this up.

30
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,110
It's much easier to edit and to manage.

31
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:25,780
The important thing here is you could use this set up in any router link.

32
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:32,390
You can always pass an object to as you saw you could also use an object just to just set the path and

33
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:39,840
it's the same object you can pass when having your routing happen in code like we do here.

34
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:48,530
When I push this path I could instead also pass an object and set up the path like this or you use a

35
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,700
named road here.

36
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,920
So if I gave my hone route a name here let's say I assigned the name

37
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:05,350
Hoenn to it then I can go here and simply use name home just like this and I could pass parents here

38
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,230
to have this route expected once.

39
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,290
And you will see if I now reload this and click go to home.

40
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,280
It still works.

41
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:19,090
Now with a name drought and passing an object to powerful features which make routing much more convenient.

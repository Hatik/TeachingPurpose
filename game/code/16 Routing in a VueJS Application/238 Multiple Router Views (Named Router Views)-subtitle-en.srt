1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,390
Well we already learned a lot about in here.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,320
We'll learn about how to set up routes how to use nest rods how to pass parameters how to react to changes

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,660
to a parameter how to use query parameters and much more.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,790
There's still some things to come and I want to start with.

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:23,920
One nice feature you honesty won't need all the time but which can be very nice if you do need it.

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,850
You can not only name your routes but also your outdrew the use.

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,710
Where would you use that.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,260
Now we do have a nice looking header here like this one.

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,530
Now let's say we want to attach it at the bottom if we are in the user area for some reason we want

10
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,070
to have the header on the bottom there.

11
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:51,690
So in our home component excuse me in our app component I will no longer include the app like this instead

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:59,490
I want to have a second router view where the app Hatteras loaded though it may be in different positions

13
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,430
depending on which route we're visiting.

14
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,100
For this I'll actually replicate this one more time.

15
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:14,280
And now we can give our router views here names like hador top for example and down there that could

16
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,920
be had for Bawden and the medlars views.

17
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,920
Unnamed this will be the default router view where everything will be loaded where we don't assign a

18
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,810
specific name explicitly.

19
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,480
How do we assign names.

20
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,870
Well and you route's chase file.

21
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:38,440
I can now add a new parameter or a new property year components and therefore I will remove component

22
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:42,870
because now we're loading multiple components components as an object.

23
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:51,740
And here I do have my default component which is simply my home component but I also do have my header

24
00:01:51,790 --> 00:02:02,530
top component hador top and this now refers to does named router view here so this header top here has

25
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,360
to match this name and this shall be my header which I.

26
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,470
First of all have to import.

27
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:15,640
So let me quickly do that to load my header here and now I'm setting this up to work like this if I

28
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,150
reload the page and I go to home.

29
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,570
We see the header here.

30
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:25,360
But if I go to user it's gone because there are not including it yet we don't see an error here.

31
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,250
This is just how it works.

32
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,550
And it's not loaded at the bottom.

33
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:36,370
Now for the user I want to load it at the bottom so therefore I will grab this components set up here

34
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,460
add it here for my user route as well.

35
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:47,440
The default Now here is of course user nested routes still work but the header bottom shall now be populated

36
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,930
with the header.

37
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,950
Now this will lead to your head or being at the bottom for use user related routes and it being at the

38
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,580
top for a home related role or the other routes.

39
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:04,350
Now of course this specific use case doesn't provide the best user experience but I think you see where

40
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,190
this could be useful or be where you could use that.

41
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:12,100
Basically whenever you want to switch your layout around depending on the route you were at and then

42
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:18,490
named route reviews make it easy for you to reserve certain spots in your lay out in your code and your

43
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:25,180
HMO code to dynamically render pieces of your application there depending on which route you're navigating

44
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:25,490
to.

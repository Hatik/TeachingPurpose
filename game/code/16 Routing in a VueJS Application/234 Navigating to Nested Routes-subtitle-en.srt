1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:07,910
So I want to be able to click a list item here and load the appropriate user detail component and pass

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,340
the parameter to it.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:15,730
Well nothing easier than that in user start of you fall which is where I have these list items I will

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,240
simply replace replace a list item with router link against you.

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,060
Well used as router link component of your router ships with.

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:29,260
So let me quickly replace all of that with this.

7
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,600
And of course I still want to use the list item.

8
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,350
So therefore I will quickly add Ptak equals list item there.

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:46,200
So if there's my rattlings are now set up of course I also need to add the two tag or two attribute

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,270
to be precise.

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,710
So quickly restructure that so that this becomes easy to read.

12
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,870
And the first Routier shell navigate to what now.

13
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,580
Well it should navigate to slash user.

14
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,460
This is my main route here.

15
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:09,270
And then for user 1 it Shell add slash 1 to it.

16
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,820
So a user start this will go to slash user 1.

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,120
And of course a real application you might dynamically folder from an air raid.

18
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,320
And keep in mind you can bind this dynamically by using colons.

19
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,790
Now you could bind it to a property which contains this POV.

20
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:31,700
So this is the first user you're here I'll use the static setup without binding a to a property.

21
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,880
And now I do have three different routes.

22
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,870
Now let's see this in action if I load this.

23
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,300
Now click on this.

24
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:44,320
We load user 1 user to user free as we can see in the URL.

25
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,240
That's great.

26
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,920
Now let's also extract the data in the user Dettol component to do this.

27
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:56,020
I go to the user detail component of course here all the Raptors in a div.

28
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:06,610
And now I want to extract the user data so the paragraph user loaded has ID and then output the ID here.

29
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:14,460
Now I could again store days in a property but since this actually is a route which will not be updated

30
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:22,560
without me navigating back to another route I can simply say don't assign route Perens ID.

31
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,030
Let's see this in action.

32
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,870
Has one has to has three.

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:34,970
Again I don't need to watch these changes because if I am on these user detail component there is no

34
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,600
way for me to click anywhere to load the user id to.

35
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:44,980
And if I manually enter it here it will get reloaded anyways so therefore I don't need to have my set

36
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:51,050
up here where I watch for changes in the route parens because that could not happen.

37
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:56,270
The combo will get regraded anyways because I have to navigate away and then reload it because in clicking

38
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,150
and Huling.

39
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:04,670
So this is how this works and how now I use a nested component with parameters to extract parameters

40
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,510
and am nested in a natural component.

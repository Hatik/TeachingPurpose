1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:09,610
To retrieve such a dynamic parameter here I can simply go to my user component and here let's say I

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,280
went to outpolled reloaded.

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:21,710
ID so here loaded ID I'll move it a bug above the button here and I'll add my data method to store the

4
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,350
property or odious idea I'm getting in a property ID.

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:39,000
And this shall now be this route Perens ID does how you access your data your wizard D or you access

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,290
route object dollar sign route again provided by View Chia's so router as the router itself where we

7
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:49,000
could navigate and so on and all US and rowdiest the active route.

8
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:53,990
So the route which was loaded and this route happens to have a Perens object.

9
00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:00,440
Again you can visit DMU router documentation to learn more about all away Lebel objects or properties

10
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,360
in general on the route object.

11
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:10,940
Now Perrin's again is an object which holds key value pairs all of the parameters we're passing in the

12
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:11,670
road.

13
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:17,960
Now we only have one key set up ID here which is why we can access it like this.

14
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,050
And your ID now and that allows me to dynamic the output here.

15
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:29,160
So by simply putting ID between call the braces and now you always see loaded IDs 10.

16
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,110
And if I manually change this year you'll see now it's 5.

17
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,490
This is how you can access the parameter you're passing.

18
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,740
How you can pass it dynamically in the first place and then output it like this in your template.

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,650
You don't have a problem with accessing it on your route because this component will only be created

20
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,460
once your route has been loaded.

21
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:56,960
So this ID parameter will always be available when you access it here but there is a case where you

22
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,990
will encounter a problem and we'll have a look at this case in the next video.

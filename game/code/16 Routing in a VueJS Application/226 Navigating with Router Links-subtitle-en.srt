1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:09,250
Well in order to be able to navigate a want to include some links obviously and for dads to be included.

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:15,340
All quickly create a new component which I'll simply name heterodox view and in there I simply want

3
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:21,970
to have a template and now I will grab some nice links from them get bootstrapped DOT COM components

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,930
and they're from their ass.

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,250
I like is Pildes look here.

6
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:32,500
So I will quickly copy this snippet over to my template and there I want to have two links.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,570
For now I want to have my home link.

8
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,270
That's correct.

9
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,520
And then use relink.

10
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:41,530
I don't want to have the active gloss on it though because I don't know if it will always be active.

11
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:46,190
We'll come back to marking a link as active in one of the next videos too.

12
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,160
So now I got those feelings with my anchor tags though.

13
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,090
I don't want to use them like this.

14
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,600
I don't want to use the Rapha attribute because that would always send the request to the server.

15
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,960
And even though that would be handled correctly I don't want to do it like this because first of all

16
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:09,280
that would limit the way how I can set up the links I wisit and it will come back to this and it will

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,670
also mean I always sent the request.

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,140
But if I'm already on the page and I click on this it would be better if the request doesn't get sent

19
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,700
in the first place because I know I don't want to leave the application.

20
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:27,700
Well for days if your chest gives us a nice little alternative to using an anchor tag at all so we're

21
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:35,830
going to remove it and instead use a component the router ships with it's called router link and it

22
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,980
will render a anchor tag India end.

23
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:44,770
So you wrap your content with this router link here but it allows you to set it up differently than

24
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,150
the normal anchor tag.

25
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,990
What you do set up here for example is you pastie to attribute.

26
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:54,160
You can also dynamically Bida by adding a colon in front of it of course we will see this in one of

27
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,550
the next use two and then two is simply the payoff you want to navigate.

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,950
You can either be a relative path like user now it'll always be appended to the current or L or slash

29
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:12,220
user or splash home or just slash in this case to append it to the end of your domain instead of the

30
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,310
end of your current.

31
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,550
You are out and year we would have Slash user for example.

32
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:26,080
Now by setting it up like this if we go back to our application and well maybe also included here that

33
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:34,930
would also help souls who quickly import the header from components after you file and then registred

34
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,070
as a local component to your.

35
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,300
So app hador Shelby our header.

36
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,440
And now I want to add it above my loaded component lets say like this.

37
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:50,410
With that in place we now see are links here and you see it works.

38
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,790
If we inspect scheduling here we see it as an anchor tag.

39
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,900
This is what I told you.

40
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,990
It gets replaced by a anchor tag.

41
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:05,250
Even though we use router link in our in our code you also see that it has this class attached to it.

42
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,820
This route will in act of class but only if it is active.

43
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:14,770
We're going to take advantage of this class soon for now the great thing is we got to our working routing

44
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:19,870
and the interesting thing is if you click this link it's actually not reloading the page.

45
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,340
You can tell by it not playing this reload animation up there.

46
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:30,320
It doesn't do that because since we used router link there's implicit click listener attached to it.

47
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,920
So if you click on it it doesn't do the default behavior of sending a request.

48
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,410
Instead it simply listens to the click and loads the correct route.

49
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,940
Which is one of the big advantages of using router link instead of the normal anchor tag.

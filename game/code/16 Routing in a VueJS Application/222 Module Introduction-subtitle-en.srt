00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:08,070
It's finally time after learning about all these core features of Mujeres after learning about how to

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:13,980
use beauty and your existing applications to build complex applications with it there's one thing we

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:20,010
haven't covered yet how to create a single page application with the chase and we couldn't cover it

4
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,390
yet because we didn't know about the router.

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:28,740
The router is the important thing about a single page application though because a single page application

6
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:36,480
means technically we only have one page the single page which is the index HVM all we load which hosts

7
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:45,530
our beauteous application and then we use this single page to simulate navigation for the users so our

8
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:52,770
eldest change but we catch all these changes and only really render this single page so that it looks

9
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,590
like as if we were revisiting different pages.

10
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,320
It looks like this to the user but behind the scenes it's always the same page.

11
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:06,720
So the big difference to the last lecture is as we no longer have application to where we need to reload

12
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,510
the page where we get different pages from the server and then only embed Mujeres to handle parts of

13
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,410
this page.

14
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,540
Now the whole application is handled through future.

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:24,570
And that is a huge thing that is really something which allows you to build very big applications based

16
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,930
on huge case.

17
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:31,320
Therefore in this section we're going to have a look at the remaining building block you'll need for

18
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,580
this the view chazzan router and how routing works in Utah has.

1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,660
It's nice that we're able to navigate with for our trolling.

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:10,060
But sometimes you want to trigger an application in your javascript code because some operation finished

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:15,520
and you want to navigate away let's say I'm going to simulate doesn't the user component here.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:22,630
Here I will first add my script parts and export my challenged group object and in here I simply want

5
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:29,910
to set up a method to which I can bind a button thereafter after I'll name it navigate to home and all

6
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,230
I want to do here is well navigate to my home page.

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,540
So in the User page itself all set up a div because again we may only have one rude element in here.

8
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,230
So let's set up this.

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,310
And then there I want to have a button.

10
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:49,090
Now of course it could just use a fragile link but you get my point I think what I want to show here.

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,240
So go to a home and then I want to add a click listener and execute navigate to home.

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,020
So this method just set up.

13
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,540
Now how do we navigate from within our code.

14
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:07,970
Well in our method we can access our view instance and then we will have the router available with dollar

15
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:08,930
assigned router.

16
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:16,140
So this is the general theme of objects from view itself or from your router in this case having the

17
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,120
dollars and at the beginning to mark that this is not our own object but instead is provided by and

18
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:29,550
repackaged to us on this router we can now trigger navigation by calling push and push is the word we

19
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:35,250
use or because we want to push it on the stack of existing routes so that our back and forward buttons

20
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,200
will work fine because we will have the old route saved as well.

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:47,550
So this pushes pushes it on the stack of routes we're at Therefore now push in its simple case simply

22
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:54,100
takes the path where we want to go like this but we could also pass an object here where we say pauvres

23
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:00,630
should be this and that is of course not really an improvement just specifying the path but I will come

24
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:07,650
back to passing an object as a routing target for roud to link as well as a side note in one of the

25
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,830
next lectures.

26
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,150
For now let's keep it simple and simply go to slash.

27
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,140
Now to see us in action.

28
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,500
I'll just add some nice styling to the Spartan.

29
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,660
Let's head over to the user page and click go to home.

30
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,580
And we're back on the home page.

31
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,700
This is how easy it is to navigate in our code.

32
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:36,420
And of course you hopefully see the similarity to our routers link where we also have this to attribute

33
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,080
here where we specify a path.

34
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,140
While I do the same year with push.

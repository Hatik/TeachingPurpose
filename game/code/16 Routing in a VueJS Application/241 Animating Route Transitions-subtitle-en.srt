1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,160
Indus routeing watch.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,690
So far we learn a lot about how the router works how we can set up routes we can configure them to our

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:14,300
needs how we can pass data how we can load different routes how we can navigate there by clicking links

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,510
or directly from code and so on.

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:25,160
Now I want to dive in some advanced topics or some additional things we can use to really get our routing

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,350
to do what we want and to really fulfill any needs our application could have.

7
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,500
Let's start by having a look at transitions.

8
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,900
So how we may animate the switching from one route to another route.

9
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,190
Now we already learn about transitions in this course or about any missions.

10
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:49,850
And the cool thing is if we have a look at our router here we can simply wrap around of you with this

11
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:56,870
transition component here because it's only one element so no transition group here only one element

12
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:02,870
because you want to transition between the components which get loaded in this router view if you want

13
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:03,920
to do that for this.

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,840
For the average high road reviews too we would wrap them in transition blocks as well.

15
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:15,140
So this will now transition or any made to switching off this route and I can show that by setting up

16
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,890
a simple animation here using various simple slide animation.

17
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:26,630
Let's say now we already saw how to set this up in the animation section.

18
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,460
So I will quickly copy in some code and then be back once I'm done.

19
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:38,140
So I copied in some CSL style to have a nice slide animation which also has some fading included.

20
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:47,050
And then I want to set the mode to out in so that the old component is first removed before the new

21
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,030
one is added.

22
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,420
Well let's have a look.

23
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:56,800
By going to our main page and now click on user you see now we have this transition.

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,780
And of course if you want a different transition you can configure it differently.

25
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:08,920
But what this shows you is how easy it is to actually enable navigation or an able transition combined

26
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,300
with navigation.

27
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,820
Important thing is wrap the router view for which you want to any made with transition and then set

28
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:21,160
up the transition as you learn that with name with your class as possible you have javascript hooks

29
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,740
with the mode and so on all the things you'll learn about animations will work just fine with routing.

30
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,560
So simply wrap your router view with the transition component and you're good to go.

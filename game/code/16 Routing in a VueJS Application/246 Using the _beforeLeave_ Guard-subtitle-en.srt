1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,540
In the last video we had a look at how to check if a user is allowed to enter somewhere.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,510
Now we want to check if the user is allowed to leave out or is set up to use or editor out to have to

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,820
confirm button.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:21,210
So now quickly add a script here to export my default object belonging to this view component and then

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,190
I want to have some methods.

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:31,050
And I also want to have some or some data my data object and in there I will simply return an object

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,020
where I said edited to false or not edited.

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,870
Let's name it.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,040
Confirmed.

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,530
Confirmed to false.

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:46,090
Don't need the method to be honest I can simply click Lisner here and said confirmed equal to true insight

12
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:46,760
there.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,530
So this now controls Weber.

14
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,550
I clicked the button or not.

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,150
And now on this component and this is not the only place where I can specify this ask before in user

16
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,720
detail with before route enter.

17
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:07,260
I can now set up a for roud leave again is the only place where I can do this because while it is in

18
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,880
the component where I want to check this right this is right before I actually do navigate away.

19
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,350
So checking this on a global level would be too late.

20
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,840
The navigation would already be on its way.

21
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,920
So instead it's here in the component which decides.

22
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,450
Are you even allowed to go somewhere else.

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,610
And here I checked you from and then also next.

24
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,210
And I have to call next to let the requests continue.

25
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,540
I can also board and redirect here just like with before route enter.

26
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,220
And here it could check if disconfirmed is true.

27
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:48,210
Here of course I do have access to this confirmed because I am in the component and I'm talking about.

28
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,630
Are you allowed to leave.

29
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,450
Of course to combo when it has been created at this point of time we were using it all the time.

30
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:00,210
So here I may exit is make may access it with this and it can check if this is confirmed in which case

31
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,650
I want to navigate.

32
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,730
If it is not confirmed.

33
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,750
Well then I want to throw or show the confirmed die Diallo LOEG.

34
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,310
Are you sure to let the user decide if he wants to continue.

35
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,200
Confirm this dialog voter turn true or false depending on whether the user clicked yes or no.

36
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,010
And if this was yes then I also want to navigate away overwise.

37
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,800
I want to abort the navigation so we have to double check if the button was clicked.

38
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:35,040
You're always free to leave if the button was not clicked while then asking you with the confirmed dialog.

39
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,230
If you say yes they're OK you're allowed to leave if you say no you'll stay on this page.

40
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,150
Does what a typical set up where you want to ensure that a user doesn't navigate away by accidentally

41
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,260
hitting the back button or something like this.

42
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,610
So if this let's loads again go to added user where they are.

43
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,820
And now let's try to go to home.

44
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,000
I didn't click to confirm button since I ask if I want to leave and if I click on cancel I'm staying

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,910
on this page.

46
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:08,300
If I click on OK well then I'm allowed to leave and therefore if I now go there again.

47
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,450
And now I click confirm first and click now on go to home.

48
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:17,260
I'm instantly allowed to leave because confirmed was set to true and does the first check.

49
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:23,380
I do half year and these are the two navigation cards you have before entering and before leaving so

50
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,730
that you can really control when the user is allowed to beware in your application.

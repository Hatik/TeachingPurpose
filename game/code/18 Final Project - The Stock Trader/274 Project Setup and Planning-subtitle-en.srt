1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:11,030
This starting set up I'm well it's starting with it's the default set up we use throughout the course

2
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:16,580
is the web page simple template installed with the view Seelye.

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,250
And I haven't added that much.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,650
The after View fall is pretty empty.

5
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:26,380
Only added to this container day of year with the bootstrap container class which I as always also added

6
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,740
here as I import and my index H.T. a mouthful.

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:35,450
The main touchiest file is pretty much untouched so you can simply install the MPEG symbol template

8
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,760
and should get the same result.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,720
Now one thing we can do right away is since we're going to use you x we want to install this stage to

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,260
reset which gives us access to the spread.

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,010
OPERATOR We're going to use it later on.

12
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:56,940
So let's get started right away with NPM install minus minus say death as it's development only dependency.

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:07,940
We can install Babel preset stage 2 and this will download it and once it is downloaded we can go to

14
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:12,710
the Bible RC file and simply add it here to our presets.

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,860
So here I want to add it to this array of pre-sets.

16
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,570
The stage to reset.

17
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,030
This again locks does spread.

18
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,040
Operator.

19
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,170
Well besides dad we get everything we need.

20
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,830
And with that let's let's first think about how should our application be laid out.

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,680
If you recall the app from the last video the app will go into bult.

22
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:39,680
We had a header so that certainly makes up for a good separate component and then we had basically three

23
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,190
routes.

24
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,280
We had a home page where we had d.

25
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,600
Please go somewhere you have so much fun.

26
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:47,800
Text.

27
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:55,190
Then we had the stocks page where we could buy stocks and then we had the portfolio page where we could

28
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,520
look at our Scott stocks and sell them of course.

29
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:05,690
So these were the free pages we had plus the header sound like we at least need these four components.

30
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:12,290
Now 40 individual stocks on the stocks and on the portfolio page we're probably also needing some extra

31
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,070
components or at least that makes sense to create them.

32
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:21,180
You want to choose your components to be granular enough but you also don't want to make every badness

33
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,090
its own component.

34
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,230
So kind of find the right balance there.

35
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,390
So this what the delay.

36
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,700
I have in mind.

37
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:34,220
And with that I'd say Why don't we get started in the next video with setting up all these main components

38
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:39,560
we can think of right now and then setting up the routing so that we can switch between them and then

39
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,670
we go from there.

40
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,730
Sounds like a plan.

41
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,900
Let's start with that.

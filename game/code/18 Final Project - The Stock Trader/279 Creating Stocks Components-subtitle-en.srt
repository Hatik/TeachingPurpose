1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:06,910
So as mentioned in the last book you want to start working on these stocks component and the individual

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,000
stocks.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,180
So I'll head over to the stocks that you fall where right now we only got this template and I'll go.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,540
I'm going to replace it with a div now.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:21,280
In this div what I want to do is I kind of want a loop through all my individual stocks and then simply

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:28,120
output them here and lead bootstrap handle the place them in a grid problematic.

7
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,790
So therefore what I want to do here first is I want to set up some dummy stocks just sort of you can

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:39,040
see something we will soon change changes and manage our states differently.

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:47,050
So first of all our export default object in here and in this object I'll have my data function to return

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,940
an array of stocks.

11
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,500
And again that's just some dummy data will replace soon.

12
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,400
That's true of course not the right set up that should be a call like this.

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,590
So how is a stock defined in this application.

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:11,410
Well I want to have ID for each stock I want to have a name BMW maybe and then a price but say 110 and

15
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:18,910
then I'm going to repeat this to also get our stocks with unique IDs that will make it easier to manage

16
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:19,920
them.

17
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:26,260
With Google let's say and let's let's give it a price of 200 yes I no that's too low but just so that

18
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,900
we are actually able to buy some of them.

19
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:36,360
Apple let's say 250 and Twitter while that can't be much right.

20
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,910
So what's eight.

21
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,390
So these are the stocks are one they use.

22
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:46,650
And with these stocks and I want to loop through them and create as many stock components as needed.

23
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:52,570
So with that let's work on that stock component next because it seems to be the more interesting one.

24
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,490
I want to start with the lay out here.

25
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:59,470
So first how should this generally look like.

26
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:06,280
Well as I said I want to have some boxes with charts and distribute it across the page by bootstrap.

27
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:19,280
So we'll certainly wrap the stock in its own column class and I'll name it call as sex call M.D for

28
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:25,420
maybe so that we can fit three stock boxes next to each other on a medium sized screen and two of them

29
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,230
on a small screen and so on in there.

30
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:36,790
I want to use a div or creative which uses the panel class and also the panels success plus this will

31
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:45,910
give it these green panel like look bootstrap offers me just to let you know what I'm talking about.

32
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,440
If you go any bootstrap pates under components you're You'll also get these panels.

33
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,280
And that's what our panel looks like.

34
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,700
And there you got different panels and I want to use to screen one here to hold my stock data.

35
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,030
So that is the inclosing day.

36
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,420
I'm going to use now.

37
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,970
In this day of course when the panel having this again is a bootstrap class to give it some nice headings

38
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:16,300
style and they are one to have each read tag which will give a class of panel title and again these

39
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,630
are all bootstrap classes make it look nice.

40
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,650
And here we want to output the stock name will soon be replaced.

41
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,240
For now I'll keep it like this.

42
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:29,910
And also inside of this free tag I'll use a number of feature bootstrap offers me.

43
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,010
I can only output my name here.

44
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:39,000
I can also add small and then some extra data which will be fit nicely into that title by bootstrap.

45
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:44,600
So a year will set the price which with a placeholder right now and then looks good.

46
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,430
So does my panel heading now after the panel heading.

47
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,920
I want to have my panel body which holds the content.

48
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,180
Now the content are now a device.

49
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,100
Basically one with the input form and one with the buy button.

50
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,090
Therefore I'll have a div with declasse pool laughed.

51
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:08,770
This is a bootstrap class to make it float on the left pull it on the left side and then there I simply

52
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,380
want to have my input field which is of type.

53
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:17,440
While we can make it of type number actually I will still implement a check to make sure we do have

54
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,470
a number of valid number in there zero type number.

55
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:29,440
And then I'll give it a class of form control bootstrap class of course then I'll give it a placeholder

56
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:37,050
of quantity so that the user actually knows what we want to see here and that's it for now.

57
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,680
Of course we'll revisit this later on.

58
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,290
Then it's time to add another div with the class pool right for this by button.

59
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:52,270
So there a want to have a button which says Boy I though will also work on this caption of the button

60
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,020
because I wanna say insufficient funds if you want to buy something we can't afford.

61
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:04,690
So on this button all now add a class which button and then button success because you want the green

62
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,210
button let's say always makes buying easier.

63
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,070
And that's it for now.

64
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,140
So this list is button and is input field.

65
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:18,550
With that we got our template for this stock set up.

66
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:24,790
Now before we fill it with some life let's see if this works as intended by going back to the stock

67
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,090
start.

68
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,230
View file here and here.

69
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,130
Now one of the import is stark.

70
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:35,440
So import Stark from well and from the stock that you file.

71
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,390
And of course the other one to register it.

72
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,870
And I'm going to register this as a local component here too.

73
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,340
Again because I'm only using it it is important.

74
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,130
If it were to use it somewhere else does of course be a great global component.

75
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:55,720
So app stock is a stock here and then I want to have my stock and use the 4 on it to loop through all

76
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,710
my stocks.

77
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,410
Now and looping through all the stocks here.

78
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:05,850
I will say stock in stocks referring to my stocks I read on there and that's it for now.

79
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,870
We don't pass the data right now we'll do this soon.

80
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,310
For now I only want to see if this works.

81
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,170
So let's head over to the application and this looks pretty good.

82
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:20,260
We got four boxes which makes sense because we've got four stock items we don't see the data in there

83
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,630
of course because we don't pass it right now.

84
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:28,930
So let's work on setting up this communication and passing that data down next.

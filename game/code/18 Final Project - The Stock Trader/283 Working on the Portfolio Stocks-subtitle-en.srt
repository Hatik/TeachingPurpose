1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:05,040
So elastically we set up our portfolio here.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,740
Now we need to add it to our store by importing it.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:17,060
First of all this portfolio module we just created add it here to the modules object again and here

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:22,280
I'm just computing this portfolio means that we have two long words it would be Portfolio portfolio.

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,370
So this is now set up.

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:35,140
Now we can use all the actions and the Geter this year to also update our portfolio and to make these

7
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,130
buyback can work.

8
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,770
Let's look at the buy button.

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,830
So any stock did you fall here.

10
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,000
I do have my buy stock method here.

11
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:51,510
And in this method I now finally won a Eustice order I created to dispatch it.

12
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:57,520
So here I can say this store this patch of course that could also map my actions and then call this

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,550
action here.

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,380
But I want to do it like this dispatch.

15
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,790
And now the name of the action is Bligh's stock.

16
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:10,580
Now this action is in the stocks Marchal whereas the mutation is in the portfolio module.

17
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:15,680
You could argue that both should be in the same module and I wouldn't necessarily disagree.

18
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:21,340
I also want to show though that you can of course commit mutations across March of this year.

19
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,470
This is why I chose to use this set up and of course you could also say that the action should occur

20
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:32,750
in these stocks Marchal where as then the updating of the portfolio really belongs to the portfolio.

21
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,240
Much of that would be a different argument.

22
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:42,040
So with that I can simply dispatch buy stock here and I need to pass the order Asnes second argument

23
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,650
as my payload.

24
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,890
Now the stocks chase filed by stock doesn't do much right now does it.

25
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,870
It doesn't commit anything.

26
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:56,980
So here we need to commit buy stock and we see those global namespace even though it's a different Marchal

27
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,210
buy stock here.

28
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,850
We'll refer to despise stock mutation.

29
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:05,700
And there of course we also need to pass our order as an argument.

30
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,600
Judas mutation so that this mutation is able to pull the data it needs to pull.

31
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:18,580
So with that if we set it up like this we're actually able to dispatch just action and we can already

32
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,890
have a tiny look at this.

33
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:26,660
If we open up the console and try bite at least we don't see an error.

34
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,930
So that looks good.

35
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,810
Now to finally see if that works.

36
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:36,610
I removed US consulate and now I want to go to my portfolio and make sure that the portfolio is actually

37
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,890
printed to the screen sort of can't see if it gets updated.

38
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,700
If that works for that let's head over to the portfolio.

39
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:50,500
You fall and you're a first of all all that one has set up a day of which wraps everything that I need

40
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,630
some stock components like I do have here my stocks module.

41
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,650
Now I will copy the code from this stock view file.

42
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,570
And of course that's always a good sign that you might want to refactored though a will change quite

43
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:10,420
a lot of that code which as I explained at the beginning of this show is the reason why I decided to

44
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:17,050
use two different components instead of one but you may feel free of course to merge them into one.

45
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,450
Now first of all what else changes.

46
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:23,340
I'll get rid of the bias stock method and then I need to work on this template.

47
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,770
The general layout here is fine though it starts here at the subtitle.

48
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,040
Well not only have a price will also have a quantity here.

49
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,090
So I also want to output stock quantity of field we do have.

50
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,390
Because that is what I'll set up here in my stocks.

51
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,630
Rate when I add a new stock it has this quantity field.

52
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,780
Therefore I can access it here with outputting individual stock.

53
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:52,620
Of course we also have an input where we are able to buy things with the model here.

54
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:58,650
So that's all fine and I also want to make sure that we're not selling less than we have so that we're

55
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,670
not selling less than zero.

56
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:07,930
I will soon add some checks to all to make sure we're not selling more than we have as well as on the

57
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,240
stocks module to make sure we're not buying more than we can afford.

58
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,540
But for now I'll do it like it is and here I'll name this sell again.

59
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:22,760
We'll soon be adjusted to you then really differ a bit more from the average stock file.

60
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:27,580
So with this in place we get is hooked up.

61
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:36,130
We should name does sales start here and then I want to add my stock Methot so I'll implement sell stock

62
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,980
here and sell stock.

63
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,670
We'll now read that order as well in this order.

64
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,990
I of course will have a stock ID so this stock ID I want to have a stock price.

65
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,100
This stock price.

66
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:57,370
And we also want to have a quantity the quantity we enter into this field which is bind with bound with

67
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,870
the model to our return property here.

68
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,300
Our quantity property or excuse I do have access to the price.

69
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,160
So that should be a colon.

70
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:16,780
So I do have access to the price here because in my portfolio module in my store when getting a stock

71
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:23,250
portfolio I'm mapping each object in the xray and I do at this price field.

72
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,950
Now the only thing we're not doing right now is we're never using the stock portfolio Geter we're not

73
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,430
using it here in the singles stock I don't because that's not the place where we should use it and the

74
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,380
portfolio component is pretty empty.

75
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,620
We'll work on this soon.

76
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:43,570
But let me first finished is stock component because after creating the order we of course want to dispatch

77
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,230
it.

78
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:53,140
And now I'll show a different way to DUDAS by importing map actions from the U.S. since I only have

79
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:59,200
one action here that is a bit well too much work or you wouldn't actually need to do that you could

80
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,760
directly dispatch it here.

81
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,640
But I'll show it anyways.

82
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,990
So here I'll use the free dots to then call map actions and distribute all the properties.

83
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:16,800
Is this going to create for us and then to pass an array and I will simply import sell stock.

84
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:22,170
This now gives me access to this sell stock here.

85
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,850
I can now execute the Savely because I know this action will be created by MAP actions for me.

86
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:33,540
You could also pass an object here and map a different name for you to use in this component here.

87
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:41,020
Then the one you set up in the store sell stock is the name of Smurfit in the story.

88
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:47,650
With that we set up this note The next step is to go to our portfolio and actually load all our stocks

89
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:47,910
there.

90
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,060
So let's do that next.

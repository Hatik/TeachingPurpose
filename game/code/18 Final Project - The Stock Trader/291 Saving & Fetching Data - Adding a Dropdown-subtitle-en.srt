1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:04,180
Now let's make the dropdown work.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:09,250
I don't know if you already solved this but it's part of the head or component.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,330
So here is the place where we can simply put some code to make it work.

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:20,150
You could outsource the top down in it's own component but I'll leave it in this component and therefore

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,530
I will add some data in my Dator property here.

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:31,280
I want to store the is dropdown open property of course you might choose another name.

7
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,020
And additionally it's false because it shouldn't be open as surely.

8
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,850
Now how is a bootstrapped dropdown opened.

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:43,940
That's important to understand to know how to proceed here with the code while we get this list item

10
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,290
class dropdown.

11
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:49,620
And if we add the open class here you see it's now open.

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:56,600
So the goal is to dynamically add this we can add a dynamically binding to class here and then in the

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:05,840
object one to bind the open class to my is dropdown open data field which is true or false so it's false

14
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,780
initially therefore it's not open.

15
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,770
The Open Class is not attached.

16
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,810
So the goal now is to listen to a click and change this.

17
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:20,870
So whenever we click on it I want to change this or toggle this is drop drop down open state here.

18
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:26,790
All I need to do is on this list item where I need to add this class.

19
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:35,810
I'll also add a click listener and I will simply set is dropdown dropdown open to what it currently

20
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:36,350
is not.

21
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,210
So the opposite is dropdown open this toggles.

22
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,970
It doesn't replace you.

23
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:48,080
Now see I got a working trot down where I can toggle between opening and closing it by conditionally

24
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,240
appending or not appending.

25
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,290
This is Does this open class here excuse me this class here.

26
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,940
And this is how this works.

27
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:03,710
Now the next step is to make the save and load data buttons work and to actually send HTP requests.

28
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,530
Again a challenge for you.

29
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,170
I will use view resource as we learned it in the HGP module.

30
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,360
You of course may choose a different approach.

31
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,110
See the next video when we go from my solution to every.

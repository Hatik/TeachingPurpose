1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:08,890
Get your head are in place now how you proceed depends on how you work on such projects.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:16,980
Generally I also do make a plan before starting but here I think it's a great chance for a great thing

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:23,040
to finish the things we see so the portfolio the stocks component here.

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:30,240
So these stock Pardie these parts of the application so that we can see which features will these components

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,980
have in the end so that we're able to then arrive.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,390
How should you manage to state for that and so on.

7
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:43,590
Therefore what I want to work on next is the stock's component which includes not only the grid of stocks

8
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,730
but of course also the individual stock items.

9
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,250
So that's your next challenge start working on that.

10
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:57,150
Keep in mind that the stock's component is only a grade for the individual stock and the individual

11
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:03,570
stock has features like the name of the stock it has the price and you all that want to take into account

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,050
that you get an input field and a buy button.

13
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,400
And of course you only want to let the user buy if the input fuel does not empty and if a valid number

14
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,310
was entered and if the number is greater than zero.

15
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,860
So these are kinds of things to keep in mind with that.

16
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,550
Good luck.

17
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,900
I'll start working on this in the next video.

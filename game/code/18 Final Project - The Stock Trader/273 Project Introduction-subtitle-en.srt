1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,760
We did it.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,410
We went through the whole course.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:11,090
You really learned a lot about view chase the course learn a lot about different features how to use

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,010
these features how to use them together and when to use them.

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,360
I won't repeat them all.

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:22,550
It's been pretty much we learned about Capote and the general syntax about how to interact with the

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:30,500
Dom about animations state management routing and now you're really prepared to bolt both smaller to

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,640
medium size to really large enterprise level sized applications.

9
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,230
In this module will build our final Klores project.

10
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,000
Now it's impossible to fit all the things you learn into one project.

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,100
But this project here it covers a lot.

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,570
Here's what we're going to build.

13
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:52,320
We're going to build this stock trader app and as you can see we have as nice a starting page.

14
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,650
And then of course we can go to the stocks page here and choose one of the four stocks we got.

15
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,960
Now on the top right you see how many funds we got.

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,370
So why don't we buy 10 BMW stocks.

17
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:09,050
Well after buying that are funds of course get updated and we now see them in our portfolio or in this

18
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,670
portfolio we could now sell them.

19
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,570
But since it's the same price it doesn't make much sense.

20
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,730
So let's end the day and see where the stock went.

21
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:21,880
It looks like BMW had a pretty bad day price plummet to $75.

22
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,440
Of course not all in our portfolio but also here.

23
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,050
But plummeting prices.

24
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,720
Always a good time to ribeyes.

25
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,260
So let's buy more of it.

26
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,460
Let's hope for a recovery.

27
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,310
Well I'm denying that at least.

28
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,990
Should we go for one more day.

29
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,790
Well Dad looks better here.

30
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:45,650
So now I can sell these stocks and will overall still a loss because of my first buy but at least not

31
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,290
that bad anyways.

32
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,750
It's not all we can do.

33
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,040
Let me buy some stocks again here at them to the portfolio therefore And then we cannot only.

34
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:00,230
And today we can also save our data and that will save it on a server in the database or the web excuse

35
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,680
me.

36
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:07,160
So that means that now if everything goes very horribly we can always go back and load the data and

37
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:14,120
you'll see we're back to 81 which was the time when I saved this daises This application has our stocks

38
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:20,210
has the possibility to save all the stocks here as well as our portfolio to the Internet has.

39
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,910
And Dave Each has some nice animations between our routes here as you can tell and a lot of Aberg nice

40
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,430
things we learned from the course.

41
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,970
Now here's your challenge try to bolt us on your road.

42
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,470
I know it's a lot of features but it's nothing you have learned.

43
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:41,000
We got some drop down your way you should listen to a click and then showed us conditionally.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,310
We get animations when switching routes.

45
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,950
We've got routing to begin with whereas somehow managing the state.

46
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,020
I can tell you I'm using view X for this and so on.

47
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,940
So yes it's a lot of stuff but you can do it.

48
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,050
And if you want to follow along instead.

49
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,330
This is what I'll start with in the next if you will both this step by step and then you'll still get

50
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,140
the chance to hop off at some point and pull the rest on your own.

51
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,580
So with that I'd say let's get started.

1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:07,820
I'm not 100 percent happy with how our funds look like I want to add a filter to change your appearance

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:12,790
so therefore for go to the main chair for the cause I will trade a global full trip because I'll use

3
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,960
it in two different places ahead.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,610
And the home component and we can create a new folder with view folder as we learn our name or currency

5
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,660
the name is of course totally up to you.

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,570
And this is a function of where we get a value.

7
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:32,860
And then in the body of this function I want to return the transformed value the transformed value should

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,750
have a dollar sign at the beginning and then it should have value.

9
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,950
And then the cool thing is we get this two low cal string method and shallow script which will perform

10
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,020
it to a nice looking ditch.

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:52,450
Basically depending on which local we're using now if this emplace I can already go to my header and

12
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:59,470
after funds add as pipe symbol and then currency the name of the folder we just created and do the same

13
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,000
on the home page.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,860
So currency here that's all.

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,010
If we now have a look it looks much nicer here.

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,830
And not really here was that because I needed to reload.

17
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,390
So it looks nicer here.

18
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:20,620
If he buys something and of course updates and if we sell shares Well of course it works to sell.

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,280
Now we get nicer funds.

20
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,090
But one major feature of the app is still missing or at least two features actually we can save and

21
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:30,820
load it.

22
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,200
I'll come to this at the very end but the end date but also it doesn't work.

23
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,410
We don't randomize our stocks so that is what I want to do next.

24
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,400
I want to make this and the button work so that we can actually recalculate all stock prices.

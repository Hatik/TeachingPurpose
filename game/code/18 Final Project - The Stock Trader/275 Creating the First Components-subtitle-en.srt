1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:06,610
So in the last one year we decided on our general plan for the next three years.

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,020
Let's start with creating our components or the components here identified thus far.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:16,430
For that UltraTech components folder and of course you could also create a different folder structure

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,470
where you structure by feature for example.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,850
But I'll stick to this since this looks about right for the size of this application.

6
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:30,530
So here in this component's folder we'll certainly want a home that you file for this home page we're

7
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,400
landing on.

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,990
We want a heterodox view for let's say and then all create two subfolder in there.

9
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:44,000
The first one all name portfolio and the second folder all name stocks.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,470
So for these two main features we have in our app in the portfolio folder here I want to create my portfolio

11
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:58,910
view files that is main page and also create a stock view files for the individual stock on this portfolio

12
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,050
page.

13
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:07,570
Now any stocks file folder here all treater stocks that you file and I'll create a stock that you fall

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,320
here too.

15
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,870
Now the stock files here will have some shared code so you could also create one component and then

16
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,840
simply control what should be displayed.

17
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,040
But as it turns out there are quite a lot of differences even though on the first look they look very

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,780
similar.

19
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:28,840
So whilst you could make it work to use one single component and adjusted to the context you're loading

20
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,460
into it.

21
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:37,430
I'm going to choose the more explicit the more wealth specific Routier of creating two different components

22
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:42,320
for Dad but you can of course and that might be extra challenge use one and the same combo and for that

23
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,210
anyways We'll come back to this.

24
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,470
Let's continue with setting up our app year with all these components here in place.

25
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:55,720
I think a good start as before we are working on the individual components to simply market them.

26
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:01,850
So let's give each of them a template and I'm only up to age one tech where I say do you home component

27
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,180
and so on so that when we implement routing I can see if that works.

28
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:12,670
So I'm going to copy that code from here into my header where I of course want to say the header component.

29
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,070
Then here we got the stocks component.

30
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,900
Here we got the stock's stock component.

31
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,920
And here we got the portfolio component.

32
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:30,380
Well I didn't know you need to fold a stock component because we won't see that for now but anyways

33
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,480
the portfolio stocks of goods are now all components have a template at least.

34
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:39,530
And with that let's say now have the components sketched out of the main components created even though

35
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,190
they didn't do much right now.

36
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,830
And then next week let's have a look at how we could set up the routes and that of course is as always

37
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:51,320
a challenge where you try to come up with the possible routing set up on your own before we Densa that

38
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,000
up to gabber next video.

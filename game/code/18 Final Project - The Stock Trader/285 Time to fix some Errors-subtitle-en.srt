1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,730
So selling a stock doesn't work.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,080
We get these maximum called stack size exceeded.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,620
I do want to change the color of the box so I'll give it to my stock.

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:18,450
You follow in the portfolio folder the box color is easily changed by changing panel success panel info.

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,430
But now the question is why does selling not work.

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:26,820
I do have my cell stock method here and I'd try to order blood.

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:33,780
I don't pass the order here as it looks like so that looks like a good reason why it doesn't work.

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:39,150
Also after selling I want to reset my quantity to zero.

9
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,660
So let's see if it now works.

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,210
If I now open the cans again clear it and sell.

11
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,340
We still get this error as a dad was not related to it.

12
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,860
So let's dig deeper what's going wrong here.

13
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,680
Well it's an area which is good.

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,260
Then it occurred because it's something to watch out for.

15
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,220
I did name this method cell stock.

16
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:07,120
It's the one they execute if I clicked this button and I also map my cell stock action to be named cell

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,580
stock.

18
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,680
So both methods have the same name.

19
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,310
So whenever I click sell stock it executes this method where I call this cell stock again and again

20
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,700
and it always calls itself again.

21
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:25,250
So to fix this we have to rename either of the two functions and I will rename my action method to a

22
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,510
different name here in an object.

23
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:40,290
I will name a place cell order and bind it to sell stock in my store and then here I call place sell

24
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,670
order.

25
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,340
Now with this in place with a capital O.

26
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,650
Though with this in place we should now see that if I try it again now it works.

27
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,880
The stock is gone now too.

28
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,380
Also see if that changes our funds and so on.

29
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,770
We of course need to display our funds so let's do that next.

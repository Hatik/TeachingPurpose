1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:05,080
We set up our stocks to be visible like this.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,530
Now we all want to fill them with some data.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,980
We get some dummy data here we'll soon replace this but for now it's good to use that here.

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:20,300
Of course once you send the stock I'm at in this loop here Tudor's stock component.

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,810
We learned how to do this with props.

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:30,460
So I'm going to add this stock prop here and notice to call into binded dynamically to the stock Berryville

7
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,020
we're creating in this loop.

8
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:37,280
And with that I can go to my stock component and in here I'll add a script part to it.

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,930
Now and I want to export the default object and then this object of course set up my props and props

10
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,990
as at least stock because I'm getting individual stock sent to this component here.

11
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:57,430
Now with the stock being a whaleboat here I can of course replace my placeholders to output the actual

12
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:07,770
stock name the actual stock price and also to the start setting up my input and despite button because

13
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:13,000
I want to make them I want to make them work right at least the basic functionality.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,920
Now for the input I want to bind this to my data object so here I will return a new object of course

15
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:30,790
which is one quantity which is 0 initially and I will bind my input here by passing the model equals

16
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:41,320
quantity like this quantity does will now bind my inputs to just stay that field and we can see this

17
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:47,340
if we switch over we now see the names the real prizes and all the inputs are populated with zero.

18
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,850
The next step now is to set up the button.

19
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:55,910
For now I only want to log it to the console will soon change this though in order to set up the button

20
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:05,280
I'll add a click listener here and all I want to execute by stockier let's say Now of course to be able

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,000
to execute as I need to add my methods property in this instance.

22
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:14,720
And I want to have my buy stock method in there.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,530
And here I will create a new order.

24
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:24,960
Now this order is basically a Charles script object where I do have my stock ID and for that I can simply

25
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,870
access the stock I get passed.

26
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,110
Why prop spining or why are you property binding here.

27
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,090
The prop up there this idea of a stock I want to have a stock price.

28
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,510
This of course is this stock price.

29
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,610
That's the price of the individual stock.

30
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,960
And I want to have the quantity this quantity.

31
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,210
This is my order.

32
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,230
And what if there were of course able to calculate the total price with quantity times the individual

33
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,850
stock price.

34
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,120
Now with that I kind of want to buy it for now.

35
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,430
We don't do that because dead.

36
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,660
We will indeed view x.

37
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:08,040
We need our global state BENNETT-JONES where I'd then want to of course change my funds and so on so

38
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,080
I don't do that right now.

39
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:19,050
Instead I want to simply console doctors order and I will set this quantity back to you now thereafter

40
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,190
to zero to be precise.

41
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:27,330
So to reset it after the order if we save this and have a look at our application.

42
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:37,670
If I open the console here and enter 10 and click on by we see this almost worked though the stock price

43
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,590
of undefined.

44
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,930
That doesn't look right.

45
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:45,840
Well the reason is that this should be stock price not stock price and that Caml the case.

46
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:51,390
So with this if we try this again too that looks much better.

47
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,280
So we got our buyback nuked up we got the it put hooked up.

48
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,300
Now one thing we can do right now is I can enter minus 10 for example and bitis and you see it in the

49
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,380
console that if we have a look at this object this worked.

50
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,590
This of course is certainly not what I want.

51
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:14,810
Also I could buy more than I have funds though at the moment I don't have any fun so that something

52
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,250
will fix in the future.

53
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:22,010
But at least I want to make sure that we can't buy a negative amount of stocks right now for debt.

54
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:28,540
I will add a new attribute binding to this button where I disable it under certain conditions.

55
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,380
What are these conditions.

56
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:36,980
Well one of it is that the one to me is smaller or equal to zero.

57
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:43,490
I can buy stocks if I don't buy at least one of them now all the way I want to make sure that my number

58
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,520
is an integer.

59
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:49,600
Therefore I check if it's not an integer year in which case and what does able to button.

60
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,920
So if it's not an integer I want to disable the button with dimsum place.

61
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,660
If we go back we see that but this disabled by default if I enter minus one and stays disabled.

62
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:07,370
If I enter one it gets this disabled enabled if I enter one Dadds to aid gets disabled again because

63
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,110
that's not an entry was that I got this functionality in place.

64
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,080
I'd say that looks pretty good.

65
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:19,340
We already see that we're now reaching the point where it's hard to continue as long as we don't have

66
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,910
a proper state management in place because we want to check our funds.

67
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,090
We want to be able to execute the order.

68
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:31,400
It won't make sense to work on the portfolio if we're not able to restore our pre-Chase somewhere.

69
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,760
So the next three years are definitely about setting up view x setting up our state management.

70
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:42,020
And that again is a great challenge for you to take over at this part and try setting this up as your

71
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,660
own think about which What's in your state which mutations do you have.

72
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,920
How do you dispatch these mutations which getters do you need and so on.

73
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,350
I'll see you on the next video when I started working on that.

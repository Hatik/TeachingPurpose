1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,030
So let's have a look at the routing set up.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:13,800
I chose to use I will first of all create a new file which will name a route start Shea's and that is

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,400
optional.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,170
You don't need to outsource your out there.

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,730
But before we can set up any routes we first need to install the router right.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,130
So let's run NPM install minus minus.

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,270
Save the router like that.

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:35,340
And that should give us the the router and what the router now install We can go to the main Che's file.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:45,210
And here I want to add and you import and queue where I implored the new router from the router packets

10
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,990
here and then you'll learn that we first need to run.

11
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,410
You use your router in order to use it.

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,390
So let's do that here.

13
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,510
And able steal the router.

14
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,130
And next you want to set up the router for dad.

15
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,960
We need some file of files.

16
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,810
Some routes I should say so I'm going to set them up here an extra file export Konst routes give this

17
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,670
of course any name you like and then routes are really just an array of objects as you learned.

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,790
So we need three routes now to your home page to the portfolio and to the stocks page.

19
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:26,640
So for data I'll sort of set up the main road for just the empty lbf or just this last year which will

20
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,370
lead to our home page and there I want to load a component and this component I want to load is of course

21
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,900
the home component.

22
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,340
So your import home from.

23
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:41,280
And now it's from the components fall from the home that you fall.

24
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,450
So this now allows me to set the home component there for that first round.

25
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,240
The second Gracen now leads to the portfolio let's say.

26
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,910
So slash portfolio shell load the portfolio component of course.

27
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:04,800
So for that let's go up to our imports and add the import year of our portfolio from and out as Lefsetz

28
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,720
components folder in the portfolio folder in the portfolio view file.

29
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,320
So with that we can add the portfolio component.

30
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,500
And lastly the last drug want is set up now that of course has lead to our stocks.

31
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:24,020
So year let's links to our stocks and then adds the stocks component here.

32
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:35,680
So let me add this last import import stocks from components stocks Lupe's stocks and then the stock

33
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,280
not that fall this fall stocks that you file.

34
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,290
And then of course added years.

35
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:47,160
So these are the reroutes of what they use in this application no nested routes or anything like that

36
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,490
because routing Weiss's application is pretty straightforward.

37
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,440
So with Dadge you get all the routes configured here.

38
00:02:54,590 --> 00:03:00,050
Now since we export this we can go back to the main case file and import our routes here.

39
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:08,320
So import d routes with equilibrate Bressant since it's a named export from the maps from the route

40
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:08,710
start.

41
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:17,110
JS file and we can then use our router or create our router here in a constant let's say by running

42
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,450
new via router.

43
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:24,430
Important is that you used the you used before and then we passed an object where we can figure out

44
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,080
a router.

45
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,890
Now how do we want to configure it.

46
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:33,010
Well I want to set the mode to history to get these nice are you or else and don't have the hash tag.

47
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,820
And then I'll set my routes.

48
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,300
So since I'm importing them I would say routes routes or again uses either 6 index of just setting up

49
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,410
routes of dead.

50
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,350
The routes are configured.

51
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:51,200
And now of course we also have to add the router a year to our new instance again with the shortcut

52
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:58,070
instead of writing router router since we need this constant we want to use as a value router as well.

53
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,310
With that the router has been added to the application.

54
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,820
We got our routes.

55
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:09,910
Now let's see the action by going to the Apter file and adding a first router the new years old place

56
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:17,080
where we can load these well these routes and with that in place let's run our server with NPM run Dev

57
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:23,130
D and workflow and the server and we see the home component.

58
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:30,300
Now that's manually enter portfolio here portfolio component and if we slash stocks the stocks component

59
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:37,170
and so have dad we got our first component someplace and routing to go there with that in the next let's

60
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,880
think about the next steps and start working on them.

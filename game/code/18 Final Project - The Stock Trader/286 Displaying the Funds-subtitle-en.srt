1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:06,060
Right now we're able to buy and sell stocks at least it looks like it works.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,760
But now let's also add our funds let's display how much funds we have and let's see if they get updated

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,310
correctly once we implemented the funds.

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,520
We also want to make sure that we're not able to buy more and we can afford and so on.

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,220
So this is what I'll work on next.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,560
Let's start by displaying funds.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,300
Where do we display funds.

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:31,050
Well for one on their home page which generally is not really in the state a wanted to have.

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,830
So let's quickly work on this let's wrap it in a day of Ada age one take where we say trade or view

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:43,280
your portfolio to kind of describe what travel to do then age 6.

11
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:51,740
You may save and load your data and also age 6.

12
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:58,300
Click on and day which doesn't work yet but will soon be added to begin anew.

13
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,790
Day like that.

14
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,450
All nice but now we also want to display the funds.

15
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:10,520
So here we have a paragraph which says whoops which says your funds.

16
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,860
And then we want to output our funds like this.

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,980
No we clearly don't have access to them yet.

18
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:25,320
So let me add a new script part here where I now export a default object and in there I will simply

19
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,410
set up a computed property or it does computed property and I'll name it funds.

20
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,640
I could use map getters again but since I'm only interested in one Gedor all exits my store like this

21
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,290
my getters stair and then the funds to get my funds.

22
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,280
Now we should be able to see this if we visit the home page.

23
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,460
We see funds 10000.

24
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:50,640
Now let's see if this updates if I slide ten times BMW it's less.

25
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,090
And if I now sell it 10 times we're back to 10000.

26
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,870
So this indeed seems to work.

27
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:02,280
Now with that in place let's also displayed in the header and let's make sure that I checked my funds

28
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,940
when buying stocks as well as my quantity when selling them.

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,530
So let's start by adding funds to a header.

30
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,330
And here I simply want to display them let's say here.

31
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,200
After my two links before the drop.

32
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:25,930
So here at is strong element where I say funds equals funds with strings of pollution and I'll add some

33
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:34,040
classes here to position this rightly there shall be nav bar text and nav bar right.

34
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,200
With that in place it will not work of course because what I need to do is I need to add my script down

35
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,330
there export my object and now load the funds there.

36
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,640
Now I could use map getters for this but since I'm interested in the funds only I can also say compute

37
00:02:51,640 --> 00:03:02,420
that as we it before it funds and then simply year return these store getters funds like this.

38
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,940
Now let's see if this worked.

39
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:05,210
Looks good.

40
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,400
We get the funds on the very right on the very right.

41
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,410
Just because of dishtowels we added to this strong element that is why it's positioned over there and

42
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:19,230
we can of course see that these funds also update as soon as we try to do some things.

43
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,020
Now I sold more than I thought had as you saw.

44
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,500
So that's something we'll work on in the next few.

45
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,760
And again challenge for you try solving this issue try to make sure that we're not able to buy more

46
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,250
than we can afford like so or sell more than we have like so.

47
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,490
So that is where we should work on next try to fix it on your own risk though.

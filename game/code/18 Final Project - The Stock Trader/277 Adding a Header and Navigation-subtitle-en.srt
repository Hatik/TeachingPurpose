1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,590
We get our base routing set up on the main component someplace.

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,730
Now let's continue working on this app.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:14,020
I think the logical next step in my opinion at least is to now implement a header so that we also got

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:18,680
some links to realit instead of having to manually type it in the you are all.

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:24,220
So let's add a header and for that since I use bootstrap Anyways I'll head over to bootstrap and pick

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,750
the header on their page.

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,300
So you're under component's nav bar.

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,700
We find a default bootstrap nav bar.

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,620
Now I'm grabbing the whole nav bar.

10
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:36,240
That's much more than I need but we'll strip out all the things we don't need.

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:43,160
And with that I'll go into my header file and insert this here into this template.

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,030
With that there is the whole bootstrap navigation bar.

13
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,300
Now let's remove all the things we don't need.

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:53,800
For example I would set it up to work on mobile phones to just to keep this simple and focused on a

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,090
core view of things here of course you could change this and therefore I don't need that.

16
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,410
But in here I don't need that button in my death bar header.

17
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,290
Although I don't need to commande what I do want indeed is my brand here.

18
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:12,600
Stock trader though that of course shouldn't be anchored tag.

19
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:20,260
That should be a router link instead since we want to well-managed as fru viewed as this link.

20
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:28,700
I mean so all create my router link here and of one a link to my route page just like this.

21
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,440
I also want to attach a class.

22
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,870
I can still do it as of course of naff bar brand.

23
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,120
Does this are normal bootstrap class which gives us this brand like look let's continue what we have

24
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,810
here.

25
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:49,200
How do we get our navigation on the left one to use data when I have my stocks and portfolio links there

26
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:49,710
Tony.

27
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:56,460
That idea here though I will strip strip some things here though I don't need a drop down here on the

28
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,980
left for example so I can remove that and I don't want to use the active link here.

29
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:09,160
Instead I want to basically set up my own links with router link one for the portfolio and one for these

30
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,470
stocks.

31
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:17,730
However we also want to have this anchor take here and we learned how to do this add an anchor tag between

32
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,710
the router links here because routers link should then be the oldest item in the end which also gets

33
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,710
the router link active class.

34
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,210
So like this.

35
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:33,420
And then on this first router link we want to go to slash portfolio and on the second one we want to

36
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:40,500
go to slash stocks and whilst we're at it it can already at the act of colossal let's add the act of

37
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:47,130
class attribute here and set this to active because this is what bootstrap expects.

38
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,000
On the item on the list item.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,650
Q Mark this route as active Well finally and salary's said that there should be a list item so that

40
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,490
adds tag eclipse Alyona are all reeling.

41
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,580
So that is not rendered as the anchor tag but instead as a list item with Dad we should have set up

42
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:11,520
which works with both both the bootstrap styling and our view chase app so I can remove the attribute

43
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,420
strip links here.

44
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,730
That should be an equal sign of course.

45
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,550
And with that I'd say we have our router link set up.

46
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,740
I don't need the forum here.

47
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:27,810
Now I want to have some navigation on the right though and here I want to indeed have a link which allows

48
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,660
me to end my day.

49
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:38,430
So maybe a link where I'd keep the standard anchor tag but then change does later on we'll work on that.

50
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:43,620
I'll name it and save for now and then drop down one after the dropdown.

51
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,920
I didn't import the bootstrap Chavez code though so it will not work by default because we want to write

52
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,590
the logic to open this dropdown and to handle it on our own.

53
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,930
In future yes you could of course use the bootstrap javascript package to let Wistrom handle this but

54
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:06,690
on the apprehend if you're using View chase you really want to do all or as good as all the Chalis trip

55
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,260
work.

56
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,280
Fruit view chaps.

57
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,200
So I'm going to leave the dropped on here anyway.

58
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,730
That is the Quent sense of what I want to say here.

59
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:21,870
Already ordered is anger tag which opens it though so here it will bring it simply bring that down over

60
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:30,150
multiple lines so that we can easier to see what's going on here and I'll rename it to save and load.

61
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,030
Because that is what you'll be able to do in the dropdown in the end.

62
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:38,460
When we implemented it and then regarding the dropdown links I only need two.

63
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,100
I want to be able to use save data and I want to be able to load data later on.

64
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:48,670
Now we're going to take care about the saving and loading it later with you but it's good to have it

65
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,380
set up right now.

66
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,650
Also notice the dropdown again right now will not work.

67
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,870
Will also work on that.

68
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,100
So with this I'd say we have a nice hetero place at least.

69
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,480
Template wise.

70
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,890
So if we now go back to our apt of you fall we can at this header.

71
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,270
Now in order to add it we first need to add an import here of course.

72
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,900
So let's quickly do that.

73
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:24,010
Let's import our header from this header to using components header file and then I'll registered as

74
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,410
a local component here.

75
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:32,800
Since I only use it in this component your so your Allergist's or my app hador with this header file

76
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,220
and I can therefore now add it.

77
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,040
So let's add app had are here.

78
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,610
Now the question is do I want to edit here.

79
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,800
The answer is yes.

80
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:50,820
Looks good but I also want to add a def class row year and then look for full class coal and the 12

81
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:58,310
year for some Lizer styling and then copy my router view in there.

82
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,210
That should be called X as here.

83
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:09,270
So with this in place let's have a look at our application we zebrahead are here looks already better.

84
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:15,690
One thing I want to do though is in my Aptor you file a one at a style for my body for this rude component

85
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:24,660
body to have some extra padding of 30 pixels so that not everything sits directly on the edge of that.

86
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,130
I'm liking that.

87
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,560
Let's see if it works too.

88
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,320
Great.

89
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,550
You also notice how the active link gets marked here.

90
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,980
So we get this working as it should.

91
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:40,410
With that I'd say let's move on and work on the next things in our application specifically let's first

92
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,750
think what that might be.

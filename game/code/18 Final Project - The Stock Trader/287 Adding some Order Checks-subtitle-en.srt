1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:07,070
So we want to make sure that we're not able to sell more than we have or buy for more than we can afford

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:15,400
in order to do so we need some checks for a start of a check for buying stocks here in the stock you

3
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,250
file.

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,560
Right now we never check if we actually can afford our plans.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,310
So in order to do check this I'll add a new computer property to this.

6
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:35,410
So computed is added and in there the name of the property I want to add is insufficient funds.

7
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,720
Is this a method like all the properties.

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:43,370
And here I simply want to return this quantity referring to the quantity entered into the input field

9
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:52,300
times this stock stocks of course to this component price greater this funds.

10
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,880
So I do check if my quantity I plan to buy.

11
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,130
Multiply the price of the stock of business greater funds.

12
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,990
So it is true or false.

13
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:07,030
And now with this compute property which is true or false I can go to my bottom and simply disable it

14
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,240
in if insufficient funds is true.

15
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,850
And then add up or assign to them perform the Obert checks.

16
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,470
So if this is true then this bottom will be disabled.

17
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,830
Now of course funds is not whaleboat yet for it to become available.

18
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:32,500
I again need to my need to add my property for debt where I return this store gathers funds as we did

19
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,050
at many times before.

20
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:40,360
Now if there's someplace we can check it is if you look at the app and enter a high number the button

21
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,980
indeed gets disabled.

22
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,680
Now all we want to update the text we see on the button depending on this.

23
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,820
So use interpellation for this.

24
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,800
And here I simply want to check ins of fish and funds.

25
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,650
Great word when you are talking what's writing.

26
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:04,060
And if this is true I know I don't have enough so I want to print insufficient funds in this case otherwise

27
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,470
I print buy.

28
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,540
So let's see if that also works.

29
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,320
It showed.

30
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,150
Yes looks good.

31
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,470
Howard works great.

32
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,540
So with that we're making sure we're getting an error message if we're trying to buy something we can't

33
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,410
afford.

34
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,310
We also may put a red border around the input in such a case.

35
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:27,190
So let's point out there Nemec class here and let's say does class which I yet have to add is called

36
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:32,410
danger depends on insufficient funds too.

37
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:42,330
And I will create the class your style and scope it to this component to your style is called dangerous

38
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
classes called Danger.

39
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:50,400
It simply will create a read order of one pixel which is solid and yet read.

40
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:56,640
So again if I enter a new high number a year we do get this red border around the input looks great.

41
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,340
So with that we're making sure we cannot buy more than we can afford.

42
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,920
Now I also want to make sure that we can sell more than we have.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,640
So over in the stock that you file in my portfolio more module or folder here I want to perform a kind

44
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,820
of similar check.

45
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:24,300
I will add the computed field here to add a new computer property which is called in sufficient quantity

46
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:30,060
because now it's not the funds which is the part restricting our action possibility.

47
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,020
But instead the quantity we have in our portfolio.

48
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:40,950
So you want to return this quantities of what we entered into the input field and check if it's greater

49
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,320
than the quantity in our stock.

50
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,330
Only if this is the case will I want to return that it's not possible the cost that we're trying to

51
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,140
sell more than we do have.

52
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,700
So if you want to sell more than that it's a..

53
00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:00,930
In our portfolio we'll get well not an error but we'll disable the button was all disable the button

54
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:07,680
if insufficient quantity is true or one of the conditions of course

55
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,110
end in such a case I also want to output.

56
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,500
So check if insufficient quantity is true.

57
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:24,410
And then I want to output not enough stocks otherwise I will output sell like this.

58
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:35,660
And why don't we also copy that scope's style over there to also mark the input as well.

59
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,300
Wrong.

60
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:45,300
If this is actually the case so have to same check here danger is insufficient quantity and danger of

61
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,240
course refers to this class.

62
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,980
So now why do you buy one and I want to sell two.

63
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,690
I get not enough stocks.

64
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:59,940
It kind of comes ugly here I have to admit on simply due to the styling.

65
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,700
So let me maybe just change this too.

66
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:08,840
Not enough to have a quick fix at hand looks better and I can sell one stock of course.

67
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,800
Zero is not allowed because it's who last but if one does work.

68
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,600
So now we get these checks someplace place were able to sell our stocks and buy at the funds get updated.

69
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,260
Everything seems to work great.

70
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:28,290
The next thing is a minor thing but the funds if we look at them it works but it's not looking great

71
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,830
but be nice to have a dollar sign and form it is more like a currency.

72
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,640
So next challenge for you may maybe a filter is helpful here.

73
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,400
Let's try building it together in the next video.

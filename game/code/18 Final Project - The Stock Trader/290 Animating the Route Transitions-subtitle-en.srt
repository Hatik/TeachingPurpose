1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,510
Let's start with any mentions.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:09,380
And this of course again is a challenge where you make sure that these switches between the different

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,110
routes are animated of course.

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:18,110
Choose any animation of your choice or whatever you like animating the transition between routes as

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,310
easy as he learned in the last module.

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,060
All we have to do is go in the app you follow.

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:30,260
We have a router view and add a transition here now and this transition will place the router view and

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,850
then we can choose any name.

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,250
Let's say we name or animation slide.

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,280
This will influence which C S-Class we're using set the mode to out into first and he made the old route

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,650
out before adding the new one.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,030
All of this I go to my styles here.

13
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,810
And then I want to add the slide enter.

14
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:58,820
Since I named it slide your slide enter active class and I'll add the slide slide Leave Act of class.

15
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,740
These are the only two classes I need because I'm going to use animations.

16
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:10,760
So I'll set up some keyframes here for a slide in for example where I want to animate from somewhere

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:18,550
to somewhere and this is somewhere is in the From case that I want to have this nice sliding animation

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:26,300
so I will translate y minus 40 pixels and Zabdiel pasty to zero.

19
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:33,490
And the goal is to then reach trends for him translate y of zeros so do you.

20
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,670
And position of this item and set the opacity to one of course.

21
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,700
Now all handled in this keyframe.

22
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:46,460
And I also need keyframes for sliding it out of course because I want to animate this in the opposite

23
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,610
direction.

24
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:58,400
So therefore here I will set up a from position of translate wise 0 because I want to start at the real

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,200
position of this element.

26
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:11,030
And your pace of course is one and the goal is to then go to transform translate y minus for the pixels

27
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,790
and set the pace to Ciro.

28
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,140
So this will fade and slide it.

29
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:23,840
And now it can use these keyframes here in my classes with the animation keyword or property play slide

30
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:31,490
in when entering a to over let's say 200 milliseconds ease out and then four words to keep dnt position

31
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:39,290
and upon leaving also want to play animation slide out it is all also 200 milliseconds ease out and

32
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:46,010
forwards and that is all that should take these few keyframes and classes together with the transition

33
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:51,710
component wrapping around all of you with the names sleights it up slide of course here refers to the

34
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:58,950
names these classes and have to have this in place we already see a nice animation here.

35
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,460
So let's fill our portfolio to also see the change there.

36
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:03,530
Looks good.

37
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,590
So now we get the animation in place.

38
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:12,000
Let's now wrap this up by making the save and load buttons work or the dropdown to begin with.

1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:08,290
With the individual stocks set up any portfolio you fall I'll add a script because now when I get all

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:16,020
my stocks here so I will export a default object here and this object now has a few properties.

3
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,960
And here are set up by gatherer's.

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:23,770
Now I'm only interested in one getters could access it directly but ask before with the actions I want

5
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:31,630
to show how to use Map getters so imported from view X and then computed all used as free dots indexed

6
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,390
eats bread.

7
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,300
Operator.

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:40,120
And then I call map getters and it could simply pass an array to map stock portfolio which is the name

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,650
of the getter here.

10
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,150
To name stock portfolio in this local file.

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,700
But if I want to use a different name and this file for example stocks then I set it up as an object

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:57,970
where I map stocks to the name and the store which is a stock portfolio with that all that's left to

13
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:06,360
do for me is I need to add my components this local portfolio stock component which are there for also

14
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:15,170
import from the stock view file and all named app stock stock.

15
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:21,580
I don't have any naming conflicts with using AP's stock here and also in this file because both are

16
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:30,420
local components and left the thing left for me to do is here I want to loop through all my stocks.

17
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:37,940
So with the four I want to loop through stock in stocks stocks now referring to my getting here so this

18
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,260
will be a proper deal but directly from the state.

19
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:48,110
And of course they do pass stock as a Purab to ABS stock because they're I do expect it.

20
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,980
Well let's see if that all works as intended.

21
00:01:51,190 --> 00:02:01,700
If we buy a new share of BMW and go to the portfolio we now see William W. quantity one here and if

22
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:08,310
we now sell one well then we get an error or a source selling doesn't work yet.

23
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,710
However buying it it works.

24
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,500
Now let's fix the selling.

25
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,990
And let's also change this from a Dreambox to let's say a blue box.

26
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,710
Just some stylistic change.

27
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,330
I'll do both in the next video.

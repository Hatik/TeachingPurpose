1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:07,570
Now when loading stocks I will of course trigger it here in the header but I don't want to execute all

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:14,140
the logic here because when loading starts we actually do change our state because we basically set

3
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,210
our old state to the new state we just fetch from the database.

4
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:24,160
So first of all I'll add a click listener here to load the data and I'll name and load data.

5
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:31,690
Of course I also need to have a method here load data maybe and in load data.

6
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:37,220
I now want to execute a load data action in my store.

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,100
Now that action doesn't exist yet.

8
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,220
Never in stocks here nor in portfolio.

9
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:53,560
So let's add one the thing why it doesn't exist yet is where the reason is that this really influenzas

10
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,590
both portfolio and stocks.

11
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,660
We changed the state in both pieces.

12
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,220
Therefore I will treat a new file in the store itself acts and actions.

13
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:08,820
J.S. here where I wanna trigger the respective committees I need.

14
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,460
I need an action because it will run asynchronously.

15
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:19,120
So in here I will export a constant and late name and load data.

16
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:25,640
For example this will be the name of the action and this shall be a function where of course I do get

17
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,200
my commit function.

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,370
I'm not getting any payload because I'm passing one and says Here I want to reach out to the server

19
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,250
so I will use view now to be able to use view of course.

20
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,260
All I need to imported.

21
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,230
Otherwise we don't have access to it in this file.

22
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,430
View HTP.

23
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,680
Now without a dollar sign.

24
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:48,600
Because we're accessing it directly on the view object itself.

25
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,980
Get and of course you also need to read to reach out to data don't Jason.

26
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,340
Now once we get it I want to execute.

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,350
Then because we do have a promise here.

28
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:07,190
Keep this in mind and there I simply want to extract the data and transform it into a charitable object

29
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,210
which also gives us back a promise so we need to call.

30
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,780
Then again this is what we learned in the new resource module in this course.

31
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,560
And then I got my extracted data here.

32
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,930
Or let's just name it data that short I guess.

33
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:30,250
And with that data I first want to check if we actually do have any data so if data.

34
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,780
Otherwise there's nothing we can do with it because if we click load and there is no data on the server

35
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,870
Well then I don't want to try to set my state to it.

36
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:46,640
So in this case I will get my stocks from data and then the stocks field because this if you have a

37
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,650
look at it is how it's set up in data.

38
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,820
We get those stocks.

39
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:56,600
Note We also got stock portfolio and funds so that will be what I also extract funds from Damodara funds

40
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:07,600
and also my stock portfolio from data stock portfolio like this post that I extracted all the data from

41
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,400
the body I got back with the request or with the response.

42
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:20,130
I want to create a new portfolio with this new object where I simply store stock portfolio and funds.

43
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:28,480
And this of course is the state I set up in the portfolio Chia's file with funds and my stocks so the

44
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:38,510
last step and then is to commit to mutations the first mutation is set stocks I do to have that here

45
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:45,550
where I simply well exchange my stocks and I will need the same for portfolio so year.

46
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,750
I also want to add said portfolio to be able to override that.

47
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,420
Whenever we do actually hit that load button.

48
00:03:54,740 --> 00:04:01,580
So said portfolio also takes the state and this new portfolio I'll pass with the commit function and

49
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,380
then I want to set state funds equal to portfolio funds.

50
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:17,690
I don't want to set state stocks desir of stocks in my portfolio to portfolio stock portfolio or for

51
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,670
us to want to check if that exists.

52
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:28,040
If this is empty in this case I want to set it to an empty array Otherwise I'm checking if it exists.

53
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,450
If yes I will set it to it.

54
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,720
I'll revise to an empty array.

55
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,120
That is how I should say it.

56
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,340
So I get said portfolio No.

57
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,850
2 with that I can only commit set stocks and pass along my stocks.

58
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:52,550
But I can also execute set or commit said portfolio and pass along my portfolio like this.

59
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,020
So this is my load data action.

60
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,380
Now of course in the header we're not using it.

61
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,350
So let's have our it is all up and tested in the next video.

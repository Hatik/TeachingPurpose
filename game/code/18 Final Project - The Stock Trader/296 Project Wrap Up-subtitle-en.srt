1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,460
Well we really achieved a lot.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,080
It was quite a long module quite a big project.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,580
Some errors were made but I think that's not too bad.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:15,790
I left them intentionally because is where you can also learn a lot because you see some of the tiny

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:22,590
little mistakes you make here and there which really can take some time but which are having a big impact

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,760
even though they might look tiny in one place.

7
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,380
Anyways it's a great project here.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,370
It uses many of the things we learn throughout this course.

9
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:36,680
Animation routeing view x statements last conditionals and much more.

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,490
So really a lot of the future has features.

11
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,400
Of course it doesn't use every single feature.

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,190
Of course there are no nested routes for example because it's pretty impossible to create such a big

13
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:53,610
project and then still make it work and of course this project is already pretty long.

14
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,480
It's a challenge for you though.

15
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,060
Set your own project set your own goals.

16
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:04,530
Look at some popular web apps and try rebuilding them with viewed as a tool to learn here.

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,860
That's something no one can teach you but how you will learn the most.

18
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,770
And with that I really can say I hope you enjoyed it.

19
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,800
And we're not done yet.

20
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,670
We still have to have a look at how we can deploy this project in the next course.

1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,260
So in the last we created our action to get the data.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:11,500
We also added this said portfolio mutation to portfolio chase in the modules folder.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,480
Now let's hook it up in the head.

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:21,040
I got my load data method and here I want to call this load data action to do so I first need to get

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,190
access to it.

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:29,500
I already do map actions here so I can simply Also map my load data action though that will give us

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,610
a problem we already had the name here matches the name down there.

8
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,870
So to prevent this from happening I will instead map it again.

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:50,040
So we'll map randomize stocks to randomize stocks but I'll name the fetch data here and map it to load

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,660
data and my store does allows me to here called this fetch data like that.

11
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,090
However this still will not do it because the action is set up here is exported but never do import

12
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:02,740
it.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,970
So you have to go to my store and here I need to import that.

14
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,930
So import everything as actions from my actions file here.

15
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,320
It's only one constant but it could be more.

16
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,400
And then I want to add it to my story as actions.

17
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,000
Again the long form would be actions mapped to actions.

18
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,060
But since it's the names for the same name I take the shorter form.

19
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,700
Now if Dad let's go back to the application we see our portfolio is empty here but on firebase we do

20
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,250
have a stock portfolio.

21
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,290
So if we load Well nothing happens it should change.

22
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,720
We can see it that our funds get updated and our stock prices too.

23
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,080
So somehow the portfolio is not loaded correctly.

24
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,180
Let's have a look at what's going wrong here.

25
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:55,810
That was a very very tiny but very powerful mistake here in the header where I saved data.

26
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,980
I accidentally named the field work saved my stock portfolio stock portfolio.

27
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,940
It should be portfolio of course because by naming it wrongly here I was not able to extract that here

28
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:15,860
where I tried to access stock portfolio which doesn't exist while it should exist now by simply buying

29
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,280
some stocks here.

30
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,320
Ending the day and saving to again and now reloading.

31
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,930
We see the data was overwritten here of course on firebase server and now had load.

32
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,020
We see now it gets loaded correctly.

33
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,280
Now we see it here.

34
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:39,750
Now we can still end the day of course you Sollars with a nice profit and always reload and go back.

35
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,650
Now we really get all the things in place I wanted to put in place in this application.

36
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,080
So let me wrap it up in the next video.

1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:10,120
There also is one little extra I wanted to show you if you have to find some errors and you're debugging

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,930
your app you'll learn how to debug that earlier.

3
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,620
But there is a nice tool especially when using view x.

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,970
It's called The View developer tools.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,010
Simply google for it and you should find it and grome store kind of you can then add it to your browser.

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,720
I already did this.

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,370
And once you added it you can open it in your developer tools here under View.

8
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:38,260
Now the nice thing is these developer tools show you all your components and you can inspect your components.

9
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,740
For example you loaded with the data they currently have.

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,110
See if it's computed or not so you can really dive into that.

11
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:53,010
But what you can also do is you can go to the view x tab here and the nice thing is if I buy it a new

12
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,890
entry gets added by stock.

13
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:02,860
We see the time I can now also if y decreases go back to the portfolio and sell this.

14
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,320
Now we sell stock

15
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,250
like this and I can always reword it like that.

16
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:21,680
So you can always switch back to older States to basically see you or do time travel through your different

17
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,900
states you had.

18
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,650
So that's really nice.

19
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:32,360
You can always use this tool to do something but then still have a look at how it looked before you

20
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,050
did this or even reworked it.

21
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:42,560
So that's a nice tool to analyze your view explo your payload the data you sent how your application

22
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,570
looked at a certain point of time.

23
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:49,710
And together with the other thing of analyzing your component Stehr which you already had a look at.

24
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,610
This really is a powerful tool.

25
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,080
You want to make sure to use when developing view as viewed as applications.

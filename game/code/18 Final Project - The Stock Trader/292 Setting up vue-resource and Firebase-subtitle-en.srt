1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,180
So let's add HTP functionalities.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:12,870
But first and soling view resource I once thought of NPM so and pre-install minus minus save view resource

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,610
here.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,840
And this will again added to our dependencies in this project here.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,600
And then in remaindered J S file I want to import it up here.

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:30,430
So import view resource here from view resource like that.

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,740
And then of course as the router we have to use it.

8
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:41,870
So we have to add that here view resource like this that we're now able to send requests.

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:48,780
Now I'm one of use or set up my bag and I will use firebase again because that really works well and

10
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,430
it's free.

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,140
So it's a great back and forth little testing applications like these.

12
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:59,810
And there I want to go to my console and now the goal was to create a new project all named viewed as

13
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:05,490
a stock trader could choose any name of your ball if you were liking basically.

14
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:13,220
So here I will choose my country then and create this project and I'll see you once I'm in the console.

15
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:18,900
So inside the project now and the first thing is I'll use the database so here in the rules of the database

16
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,380
I again friend read and write access to everyone.

17
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,150
So everyone is able to do that.

18
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,540
Not the production settings you want to use but great for testing thereafter.

19
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,280
Does this to you or else we'll use.

20
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:40,290
I'm going to copy this because now in my set up here I want to set up these main you are.

21
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,010
We're always reaching out to.

22
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,970
So here I will simply said you HTP which I can access after adding You resource.

23
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:53,880
So after using your resource here and on the options I want to set my route you are l to this link.

24
00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:00,070
I just copied so of that I make sure that all requests will be sent to this link here.

25
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,220
And then I add different things which need to be added different.

26
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,510
The deposits deposit after dismayed domain here basically.

27
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,560
So that's the set up with Dad looks good.

28
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,990
Let's now work on storing our data.
